# SDK Evaluation Harness - Mini-FRD

## **Part 1 â€” Mini-FRD (What & Why)**

### 1. **What**
Build an evaluation harness using Jean Memory's React and Python SDKs that simulates real user interactions and tests extended conversation sessions (10-35 interactions) for end-to-end evaluation.

### 2. **Why**
Unit testing individual components doesn't validate end-to-end user experience. SDK-based testing provides the most realistic evaluation by using the actual user interface, ensuring that optimizations improve real-world performance rather than just isolated metrics.

### 3. **Scope**

**In Scope:**
- React SDK integration for conversation session testing
- Python SDK integration for programmatic evaluation
- Extended conversation session simulation (10-35 interactions)
- End-to-end flow testing through actual user interfaces
- Memory injection and retrieval testing via SDKs
- Real-world latency and performance measurement
- Integration with test dataset management for test case execution

**Out of Scope:**
- SDK modifications or new SDK features
- Browser automation or UI testing
- Load testing or stress testing
- Performance optimization (only measurement)
