# Test Dataset Management Suite - Mini-FRD

## **Part 1 â€” Mini-FRD (What & Why)**

### 1. **What**
Create a comprehensive test dataset management system for storing, versioning, categorizing, and maintaining evaluation datasets with support for both manual authoring and synthetic generation integration.

### 2. **Why**
Without proper dataset management, evaluation becomes unreliable and non-reproducible. A centralized system ensures test case quality, enables regression testing, tracks dataset evolution, and provides the foundation for consistent evaluation across development cycles.

### 3. **Scope**

**In Scope:**
- Version-controlled test dataset storage
- Test case categorization and tagging system
- Manual test case authoring tools
- Import/export functionality for standard formats
- Dataset validation and quality assurance tools
- Integration with synthetic data generator
- Gold standard human-annotated dataset management
- Performance benchmarking dataset creation

**Out of Scope:**
- Test case execution (handled by evaluation infrastructure)
- Real-time dataset updates during evaluation
- Integration with external dataset repositories
- Advanced ML-based dataset analysis

### 4. **Acceptance Criteria**
