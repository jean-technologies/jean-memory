# LLM-as-a-Judge System - Mini-FRD

## **Part 1 â€” Mini-FRD (What & Why)**

### 1. **What**
Implement an LLM-as-a-Judge system using Gemini Flash that automatically evaluates context relevance, completeness, reasoning quality, and consistency without human intervention.

### 2. **Why**
Manual evaluation doesn't scale and human annotation is expensive and time-consuming. LLM-as-a-Judge provides automated, consistent evaluation that can run continuously, enabling rapid iteration and regression detection. This is essential for measuring the subjective quality aspects that traditional metrics can't capture.

### 3. **Scope**

**In Scope:**
- Gemini Flash integration for automated scoring
- Relevance scoring (0-10 scale) for context-query alignment
- Completeness evaluation against query requirements
- Reasoning quality assessment for multi-hop queries
- Long-range consistency scoring across conversation sessions
- Judge reliability validation against human annotations
- Prompt engineering for reliable scoring

**Out of Scope:**
- Human annotation interface (manual process initially)
- Integration with external judge models beyond Gemini
- Real-time scoring during production (evaluation mode only)
- Custom judge training or fine-tuning

### 4. **Acceptance Criteria**

#### Core Judge Implementation
- [ ] Gemini Flash integration with proper error handling and retries
- [ ] Relevance scoring returns 0-10 values with explanatory reasoning
- [ ] Completeness evaluation identifies missing required information
- [ ] Reasoning quality assessment for multi-hop and temporal queries
- [ ] Consistency scoring across extended conversation sessions

#### Judge Reliability & Validation
- [ ] Judge scores correlate >0.8 with human annotations on gold standard dataset
- [ ] Consistent scoring across multiple runs (variance <0.5 points)
- [ ] Judge explanations provide actionable feedback for improvements
- [ ] Proper handling of edge cases and ambiguous queries

#### Evaluation Categories
- [ ] Single-hop recall evaluation (direct fact retrieval)
- [ ] Multi-hop reasoning assessment (cross-memory synthesis)
- [ ] Temporal reasoning evaluation (time-based context)
- [ ] Adversarial robustness testing (conflicting information)
- [ ] Commonsense reasoning integration assessment

#### Performance & Integration
- [ ] Judge evaluation completes within 2-5 seconds per query
- [ ] Async processing doesn't block main evaluation flow
- [ ] Graceful fallback when judge service unavailable
- [ ] Integration with evaluation infrastructure for metric storage
