# Evaluation Infrastructure - Mini-FRD

## **Part 1 â€” Mini-FRD (What & Why)**

### 1. **What**
Build the core evaluation infrastructure with decorator-based monitoring that can be toggled on/off without impacting production performance, providing the foundation for all other evaluation components.

### 2. **Why**
Without a non-invasive evaluation foundation, we cannot safely measure Jean Memory's performance in production or development environments. This infrastructure enables all subsequent evaluation capabilities while maintaining system stability and ensuring zero performance impact when disabled.

### 3. **Scope**

**In Scope:**
- Decorator pattern implementation for key jean_memory functions
- Environment variable toggle for evaluation mode
- Async evaluation processing to avoid blocking main flow
- Basic metric collection and storage infrastructure
- Integration with existing logging system
- Memory usage monitoring for evaluation overhead

**Out of Scope:**
- Specific evaluation metrics implementation (separate tasks)
- LLM-as-a-judge integration (separate task)
- Test data generation (separate task)
- Reporting dashboard (separate task)

### 4. **Acceptance Criteria**

#### Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Evaluation system toggles on/off via `EVALUATION_MODE` environment variable
- [ ] When disabled, zero measurable performance impact on production
- [ ] Decorator pattern requires <10 lines of changes to core functions
- [ ] Decorators applied to: `orchestrate_enhanced_context()`, `_ai_create_context_plan()`, `search_memory()`, `_format_layered_context()`

#### Performance & Safety
- [ ] Evaluation runs asynchronously without blocking user requests
- [ ] Memory overhead <50MB when evaluation active
- [ ] Evaluation failures do not affect main system functionality
- [ ] Graceful degradation when evaluation components fail

#### Basic Metric Collection
- [ ] Latency tracking for all decorated functions
- [ ] Memory consumption monitoring during evaluation
- [ ] Error rate tracking for evaluation components
- [ ] Timestamp and metadata collection for all metrics

#### Integration
- [ ] Seamless integration with existing logger infrastructure
- [ ] Metric storage compatible with future reporting components
- [ ] Clean separation between evaluation and production code paths
