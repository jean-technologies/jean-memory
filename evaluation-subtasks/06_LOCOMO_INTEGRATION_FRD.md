# LoCoMo Framework Integration - Mini-FRD

## **Part 1 â€” Mini-FRD (What & Why)**

### 1. **What**
Implement LoCoMo (Long-Term Conversational Memory) framework integration with all five reasoning types evaluation and extended conversation testing to validate Jean Memory's performance against research benchmarks.

### 2. **Why**
LoCoMo represents the current gold standard for evaluating long-term conversational memory in AI systems. Integration enables direct performance comparison with research benchmarks and validates Jean Memory's superiority as an advanced RAG system, providing credible performance claims.

### 3. **Scope**

**In Scope:**
- Five LoCoMo reasoning types implementation (single-hop, multi-hop, temporal, commonsense, adversarial)
- Extended conversation session testing (10-35 sessions)
- Long-range consistency evaluation methodology
- Event graph understanding assessment
- Performance comparison with LoCoMo benchmarks
- Jean Memory advantage validation (RAG system superiority)

**Out of Scope:**
- LoCoMo dataset replication (use synthetic data aligned with methodology)
- External LoCoMo system integration
- Research paper publication (focus on evaluation capabilities)
- Multi-modal evaluation (text-only for now)
