# Evaluation Reporting & Dashboard - Mini-FRD

## **Part 1 â€” Mini-FRD (What & Why)**

### 1. **What**
Create an automated reporting system with markdown dashboards that tracks evaluation metrics, detects performance regressions, and provides trend analysis for Jean Memory's context engineering performance.

### 2. **Why**
Raw evaluation data without clear reporting and visualization provides little actionable insight. Automated reporting enables quick identification of performance improvements/regressions, guides optimization priorities, and provides stakeholders with clear evidence of system performance and competitive advantages.

### 3. **Scope**

**In Scope:**
- Automated markdown report generation
- Performance trend analysis and visualization
- Regression detection and alerting
- LoCoMo benchmark comparison reporting
- Weekly/monthly automated report scheduling
- Key performance indicators (KPI) tracking
- Integration with all evaluation components for data aggregation

**Out of Scope:**
- Interactive web dashboard (markdown-based only)
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- External reporting tool integration
- Custom visualization libraries
