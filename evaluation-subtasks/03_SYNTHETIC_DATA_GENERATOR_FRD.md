# Synthetic Data Generator - Mini-FRD

## **Part 1 â€” Mini-FRD (What & Why)**

### 1. **What**
Build an LLM-powered synthetic data generation system that creates diverse conversation scenarios, memory sequences, and test cases across all LoCoMo reasoning types for comprehensive evaluation coverage.

### 2. **Why**
Manual test case creation is time-consuming and lacks coverage of edge cases. Synthetic generation ensures comprehensive testing across all reasoning types, difficulty levels, and scenarios while enabling rapid expansion of test datasets. This is crucial for thorough evaluation without relying solely on limited real-world data.

### 3. **Scope**

**In Scope:**
- LLM-powered conversation scenario generation
- Memory injection sequence creation for multi-hop testing
- Adversarial scenario generation (conflicting information)
- Temporal event sequence generation
- Persona-based conversation generation
- LoCoMo reasoning type coverage (single-hop, multi-hop, temporal, commonsense, adversarial)
- Difficulty level variation (simple to complex)
- Quality validation of generated test cases

**Out of Scope:**
- Real user data collection or processing
- Manual test case authoring tools (separate task)
- Integration with external data sources
- Test case execution (handled by evaluation infrastructure)
