# Jean Memory for Users - Your Universal AI Memory Layer

**Date:** August 7, 2025  
**Status:** Live Product  
**Purpose:** Enable users to have persistent memory across all their AI applications

## Executive Summary

Jean Memory provides users with a centralized memory system that works across all their AI tools - ChatGPT, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and more. By creating a Jean Memory account and connecting your AI applications, you gain persistent context that follows you everywhere, eliminating the need to re-explain yourself to each new AI tool.

## The Problem We Solve

### Current AI Fragmentation
- **ChatGPT** doesn't know what you discussed with **Claude**
- **Cursor** has no context from your **Windsurf** sessions
- Every new AI tool starts from zero, knowing nothing about you
- You constantly repeat context, preferences, and project details
- Your valuable AI interactions are siloed and lost

### The Jean Memory Solution
One account, one memory, infinite AI applications. Your conversations, documents, and context flow seamlessly between all your AI tools.

## How It Works

### 1. Sign Up for Jean Memory

Visit [jeanmemory.com](https://jeanmemory.com) and create your account:
- **Email/Password**: Traditional signup with email verification
- **Google OAuth**: One-click signup with your Google account
- **GitHub OAuth**: Perfect for developers, sign in with GitHub

### 2. Access Your Dashboard

Once logged in, you'll see your personalized dashboard featuring:
- **Apps Connected**: Track which AI tools are using your memory
- **Memories Created**: See your total memory count grow
- **Your Life's Narrative**: AI-synthesized summary of your memories
- **Integration Gallery**: Connect new AI applications

### 3. Connect Your AI Applications

#### Currently Available Integrations:

**ü§ñ AI Assistants**
- **ChatGPT**: Deep research memories integration
- **Claude Desktop**: One-click MCP install for Claude
- **Cursor**: AI-powered code editor with memory
- **Windsurf**: Another AI code editor

**üìù Document Sources**

### 4. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Setup

For AI applications that support MCP:

```bash
# Claude Desktop users - add to your config:
{
  "servers": {
    "jean-memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@jean-memory/mcp"],
      "api_key": "your_jean_api_key_here"
    }
  }
}
```

This gives your AI applications access to:
