# Jean Memory Enterprise - Private Cloud Deployment

**Date:** August 7, 2025  
**Status:** Enterprise Solution  
**Purpose:** Enable enterprises to run Jean Memory on their own infrastructure with complete data sovereignty

## Executive Summary

Jean Memory Enterprise provides the same powerful memory unification and developer SDK capabilities as our cloud offering, but deployed entirely within your organization's infrastructure. This enables enterprises with strict data requirements, regulatory compliance needs, or security policies to benefit from unified AI memory while maintaining complete control over their data.

## The Enterprise Challenge

### Current State of Enterprise AI
- **Fragmented AI Tools**: Different departments use different AI solutions
- **No Context Sharing**: ChatGPT Enterprise doesn't talk to Azure OpenAI
- **Compliance Concerns**: Data cannot leave corporate boundaries
- **Wasted Knowledge**: Every AI interaction starts from zero
- **Security Risks**: Shadow IT as employees use personal AI accounts

### Why Standard Solutions Don't Work
- **Public Cloud AI**: Data leaves your control
- **Build In-House**: 12-18 months and millions in development
- **Point Solutions**: Create more silos, not fewer
- **Traditional RAG**: Lacks relationship understanding and context

## Jean Memory Enterprise Solution

### Complete Infrastructure in Your Cloud

Deploy the entire Jean Memory stack within your infrastructure:
