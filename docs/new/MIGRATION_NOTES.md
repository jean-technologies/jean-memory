# Jean Memory Integration Migration Notes

## What was done:

1. **Copied jean_memory module**: 
   - Source: `/jean-memory/jean_memory/`
   - Destination: `/jean-memory-app/openmemory/api/jean_memory/`
   - All Python files and structure preserved exactly

2. **Updated requirements.txt**:
   - Removed: `jean-memory @ git+https://github.com/jean-technologies/jean-memory.git`
   - Added comment explaining the module is now local

3. **No import changes needed**:
   - All existing imports like `from jean_memory.mem0_adapter_optimized import ...` work as-is
   - Python will find the local module first

## How it works:

- When the API server runs from `/openmemory/api/`, Python will find the `jean_memory` folder in the same directory
- All imports will use the local copy instead of the git-installed version
- Dependencies are already in the existing requirements.txt (as noted in jean-memory's requirements.txt)

## Testing:

To verify the integration works:
```bash
cd openmemory/api
python test_jean_memory_integration.py
```

## Benefits:

1. No more external git dependency
2. Easier to modify jean_memory code directly
3. Single repository deployment
4. No version mismatch issues

## Important Notes:

- The jean_memory module functions exactly as before
- No code changes were needed in the application
- All dependencies are already in openmemory/api/requirements.txt
