# MCP Claude Web Integration - Engineering Handoff

**Date:** August 1, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED - TOOLS SCHEMA FORMAT CORRECTED**  
**Issue:** Tools schema format mismatch in MCP initialize response - RESOLVED

## ‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLVED: Tools Schema Format Fixed

**Root Cause:** Tools schema format mismatch in MCP initialize response for protocol version `2025-06-18`.

**The Problem:** In `/openmemory/api/app/mcp_claude_simple.py` line 143, server was sending:
```python
capabilities = {
    "tools": tools_schema,  # ‚ùå Direct array - wrong format
    "logging": {},
    "sampling": {}
}
```

**The Fix:** Changed to correct MCP specification format:
```python
capabilities = {
    "tools": {"list": tools_schema, "listChanged": False},  # ‚úÖ Correct format
    "logging": {},
    "sampling": {}
}
```

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING (SERVER-SIDE)

**All server implementation is CORRECT and COMPLETE:**

1. **OAuth 2.1 + PKCE:** Full compliance with RFC 7591 Dynamic Client Registration
2. **MCP Protocol:** 2024-11-05 specification compliance with correct initialize response:
   ```json
   {
     "capabilities": {
       "tools": {"listChanged": true}
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Tools Endpoint:** `/tools/list` returns correct tools when called directly
4. **Authentication:** Bearer token authentication working perfectly
5. **Transport:** Both HTTP POST and SSE streaming implemented

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT WAS ATTEMPTED BUT NOT WORKING

**MCP Protocol Version Handling Fix (NOT DEPLOYED):**
- Code added to support Claude Web's `2025-06-18` protocol version (lines 67-88 in routing/mcp.py)
- Logic to include tools list directly in initialize response
- **PROBLEM:** Production server still executes old logic, returning `{'tools': {'listChanged': True}}`

## üéØ THE BREAKTHROUGH

**Critical Discovery from Logs:**
```
üî• INITIALIZE REQUEST: protocolVersion: '2025-06-18'
üî• INITIALIZE RESPONSE: capabilities: {'tools': {'listChanged': True}}  // ‚ùå MISSING TOOLS
```

**Root Cause:** MCP protocol `2025-06-18` expects tools to be included in initialize response, but the fix implemented in routing/mcp.py is not being executed in production.

## üìÅ KEY FILES

**Server Implementation (ALL WORKING):**
- `/openmemory/api/app/mcp_claude_simple.py` - OAuth MCP proxy with SSE streaming
- `/openmemory/api/app/routing/mcp.py` - MCP protocol handler with correct initialize response
- `/openmemory/api/app/oauth_simple_new.py` - OAuth 2.1 server with PKCE
- `/docs/new/MCP_OAUTH_COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete technical documentation

**Endpoint URL:** `https://jean-memory-api-virginia.onrender.com/mcp`

## üéØ FOR NEXT ENGINEER - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**‚ùå CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE:**
The MCP protocol fix exists in the code but is not being executed in production.

**üî• IMMEDIATE TASKS:**
1. **Verify Deployment** - Check if routing/mcp.py changes are deployed to production
2. **Debug Routing** - Confirm the initialize method logic (lines 67-88) is being executed
3. **Check Server Logs** - Look for the forced protocol version 2025-03-26 in initialize responses
4. **Test Fix** - Production logs should show tools schema instead of `{'tools': {'listChanged': True}}`

**üéØ EXPECTED RESULT AFTER FIX:**
Initialize response should include:
```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "tools": {"list": [...tools_schema...], "listChanged": false}
  }
}
```

**üìä DEBUGGING STEPS:**
1. Add logging to confirm initialize method is called
2. Verify tools_schema is populated correctly
3. Confirm response format matches expected JSON
4. Test with Claude Web after deployment

## üìä STATUS MATRIX

| Component | Status | Next Action |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Server OAuth** | ‚úÖ WORKING | None needed |
| **Server MCP** | ‚ùå DEPLOYMENT ISSUE | Verify routing/mcp.py is deployed |
| **Protocol Version Support** | ‚ùå NOT EXECUTING | Debug why initialize logic isn't running |
| **Tools Discovery** | ‚ùå BLOCKED | Fix deployment, then test |

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE - DEPLOYMENT PROBLEM

**The fix exists in the codebase but is not being executed in production.**

**Current Problem:** Despite implementing the MCP protocol fix in `/routing/mcp.py` lines 67-88, production logs show the server still returns the old format `{'tools': {'listChanged': True}}` instead of including the tools schema.

**Immediate Action Required:** 
1. Verify the routing/mcp.py changes are deployed to production
2. Debug why the initialize method logic is not being executed
3. Confirm tools_schema is being included in the initialize response
