# "Sign in with Jean Memory" Action Plan V4 - REVAMPED FOR LAUNCH

**Date:** August 7, 2025  
**Status:** 🚀 **READY FOR COORDINATED LAUNCH**  
**Strategy:** Back into success using proven demos + fix OAuth blocker

---

## 🎯 **CURRENT REALITY CHECK**

### ✅ **What Actually Works (VALIDATED)**
- **NPM Package:** `jeanmemory-react@0.1.2` ✅ PUBLISHED & FUNCTIONAL
- **5 Production Apps:** All operational, all integrations working ✅
- **React SDK Components:** `useJean`, `SignInWithJean`, `JeanChat` ✅
- **Backend API:** Core Jean Memory functionality 100% operational ✅
- **Fallback Systems:** All apps work gracefully without OAuth ✅

### ⚠️ **Single Critical Blocker**  
- **OAuth Redirect URI:** `{"detail":"Invalid redirect URI"}` 
- **Impact:** Prevents end-to-end auth flow, but core functionality proven
- **Fix Time:** ~30 minutes server-side configuration

### 🏆 **Competitive Advantage PROVEN**
- **5 Working Applications** demonstrate versatility across domains
- **True 5-line integration** validated in production environments
- **First mover advantage** with actual working demos ready
