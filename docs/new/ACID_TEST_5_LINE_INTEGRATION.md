# üß™ ACID TEST: 5-Line "Sign in with Jean Memory" Integration

**Mission:** Build a working AI app with persistent memory in 5 minutes using only our public API docs.

**Success Criteria:** If this doesn't work perfectly, our "5-line integration" claim is false and we're not ready for launch.

## Test Instructions for External Developer

**Context:** You've been given this document and told that Jean Memory offers the world's first "Sign in with Memory" for AI apps. Your job is to build a simple AI chat app that remembers conversations across sessions using only the public API docs.

### Step 1: Create New React App (2 minutes)

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-jean-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
cd my-jean-app
```

### Step 2: Install Jean Memory SDK (30 seconds)

```bash
npm install @jeanmemory/react
```

**‚ùå BLOCKER:** If this fails, the SDK isn't published to NPM yet.

### Step 3: Get API Key (1 minute)

1. Go to https://jean-memory.com  
2. Sign up / Sign in
3. Get your API key from dashboard

**‚ùå BLOCKER:** If the website doesn't have clear API key generation, this fails.

### Step 4: The 5-Line Integration (1 minute)

Replace `app/page.tsx` with:

```tsx
'use client';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useJean, SignInWithJean, JeanChat } from '@jeanmemory/react';

export default function App() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const { agent } = useJean({ user });
  
  if (!agent) return <SignInWithJean apiKey="your-api-key-here" onSuccess={setUser} />;
  return <JeanChat agent={agent} />;
}
```

**‚ùå BLOCKER:** If TypeScript errors, imports fail, or components don't exist, this fails.

### Step 5: Test the Flow (1 minute)

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

**Expected Flow:**
1. ‚úÖ See "Sign in with Jean Memory" button
2. ‚úÖ Click button ‚Üí redirects to Jean Memory OAuth
3. ‚úÖ Sign in ‚Üí redirects back to app  
4. ‚úÖ See chat interface
5. ‚úÖ Type "Remember my name is Alex" ‚Üí gets response
6. ‚úÖ Refresh page ‚Üí still signed in
7. ‚úÖ Type "What's my name?" ‚Üí responds "Alex"

**‚ùå CRITICAL BLOCKERS:**
- Button doesn't appear
- OAuth redirect fails  
- OAuth callback fails
- Chat doesn't work
- Memory doesn't persist
- Any error in browser console

- [ ] User can sign in on OAuth page
- [ ] Callback redirects work with `http://localhost:3000/callback`
- [ ] Token exchange endpoint `/sdk/oauth/token` works
- [ ] User info endpoint `/sdk/oauth/userinfo` works
- [ ] User object is returned to `onSuccess` callback

### ‚¨ú Chat & Memory

## Blockers Found (Fill This Out)

### üî¥ Critical Issues:
- [ ] NPM package not published
- [ ] OAuth client registration required
- [ ] API endpoints not working
- [ ] Components not working
- [ ] Memory not persisting

### üü° Polish Issues:
- [ ] Confusing error messages
- [ ] Poor styling
- [ ] Missing loading states
- [ ] Documentation gaps

### üü¢ Status:
- [ ] ‚úÖ **READY FOR LAUNCH** - Everything works perfectly
- [ ] ‚ùå **NOT READY** - Critical blockers exist

## Fix-It List

If this test fails, here's what needs immediate attention:

1. **Publish NPM Package** - `cd sdk/react && npm publish`
2. **Fix OAuth Client Registration** - Auto-register API keys as OAuth clients
3. **Fix API Endpoints** - Ensure all `/sdk/oauth/*` endpoints work
4. **Fix Component Issues** - Test all React components work correctly
5. **Fix Memory Issues** - Ensure persistence works end-to-end
6. **Update Documentation** - Make API docs crystal clear

---

**Bottom Line:** If an external developer can't follow this guide and build a working AI app with persistent memory in 5 minutes, we're not ready for the "first universal memory layer" claim.**

**Test this ruthlessly. No excuses. Fix everything until it's perfect.**
