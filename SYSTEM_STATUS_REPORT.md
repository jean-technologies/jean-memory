## 🚀 Recent Achievements

### **Episode Generation Fix** ✅
- **Issue**: Episodes weren't being created (0 found)
- **Solution**: Implemented proper clustering strategies:
  - Temporal clustering (by day)
  - Semantic clustering (by topic)
  - Weekly summary episodes
- **Result**: 6 episodes successfully created from 20 memories

### **PostgreSQL Compatibility** ✅
- **Issue**: json vs jsonb column type mismatch
- **Solution**: Created `schema_compatibility_checker.py`
- **Result**: Schema differences handled gracefully

### **API Integration** ✅
- **Issue**: OpenAI API key configuration
- **Solution**: Proper .env file setup and environment variable handling
- **Result**: All API calls returning HTTP 200 OK

## 📊 Test Results Analysis

### **Query Performance Breakdown**

| Query | Response Quality | Sources | Processing Time |
|-------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|
| "What exercises do I do?" | High relevance | 10 | 1.10s |
| "Where do I like to work out?" | Excellent context | 10 | 0.89s |
| "What are my fitness goals?" | Comprehensive | 10 | 0.83s |
| "What projects am I working on?" | Good coverage | 10 | 0.96s |
| "Who do I work with?" | Contextual inference | 10 | 0.76s |
| "What are my daily routines?" | Detailed patterns | 10 | 0.77s |
| "What places do I visit frequently?" | Location-aware | 10 | 0.69s |

### **Sample High-Quality Response**
> **Query**: "What are my fitness goals?"  
> **Response**: "Based on your memories, it seems like your fitness goals might include building endurance for activities like long-distance running, as indicated by your first long-distance run along Crissy Field. Additionally, your interest in skydiving suggests that you may want to enhance your overall fitness and strength to prepare for that adventurous activity..."
