description: "A powerful, stateful protocol for building advanced agentic systems."

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to provide a more powerful and flexible way to connect AI agents to tools and data. It standardizes the piping of context and memory across the internet, enabling a new level of interoperability for AI systems.

While our REST API is perfect for many use cases, MCP is the ideal choice for developers building sophisticated, agentic systems that require stateful connections, real-time communication, and dynamic tool use.

## Why Choose MCP over the REST API?

| Feature                       | REST API                                   | Model Context Protocol (MCP)                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Connection**                | Stateless (each request is independent)    | Stateful (a continuous, persistent connection)             |
| **Communication**             | Request-Response (client-driven)           | Bidirectional (server can push updates to the agent)       |
| **Tool Use**                  | Static (hard-coded to specific endpoints)  | Dynamic (agent can discover and learn to use new tools)    |
| **Context Management**        | Handled in the prompt (can lead to bloat)  | Managed by the protocol (more efficient and scalable)      |

In short, if you are building a simple application and just need to store and retrieve memories, our REST API is a great choice. If you are building a complex, autonomous agent that needs to interact with its environment in real-time, MCP is the way to go.

## Key Benefits of MCP for Agentic Memory

*   **Complex, Multi-Step Tasks**: Because MCP maintains a stateful connection, it's perfect for complex workflows where context needs to be preserved across multiple steps. The agent can have an ongoing "conversation" with a tool, rather than sending a series of disconnected requests.

*   **Real-Time Reactivity**: MCP allows tools to proactively push information to the agent. This is essential for building agents that can react to live events, such as a file being updated, a new message arriving, or a change in a database.

*   **Enhanced Autonomy and Adaptability**: With dynamic tool discovery, your agent can learn to use new tools and capabilities without being explicitly re-programmed. This allows you to build more adaptive and autonomous agents that can evolve over time.

*   **Efficiency and Scalability**: By managing context and tool definitions outside of the prompt, MCP avoids the "prompt bloat" that can limit the performance and scalability of agents built on REST APIs.

## How to Get Started

To get started with MCP, you'll need to connect to one of our MCP servers. The authentication is handled via a standard OAuth 2.1 flow, which is initiated when you connect.

You can find more details on how to implement this in our SDK documentation.
