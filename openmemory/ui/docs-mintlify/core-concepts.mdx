## The Pyramid of Integration

Our architecture can be understood as a pyramid. Developers can integrate at the layer that best suits their needs, with the SDK being the primary path for most.

- **Layer 1 (Core API):** The lowest-level functions. This is not the primary integration path for most developers.

- **Layer 2 (MCP):** The structured protocol our system uses for AI agent "tool use." For most developers, this is an implementation detail they don't need to worry about.

- **Layer 3 (The SDK):** **This is the primary product for developers.** The SDK is a headless, language-specific wrapper that makes it simple to call our context engine. Our React, Python, and Node.js SDKs are all implementations of this layer.

- **Layer 4 (UI Component):** An optional, pre-built component (like `<JeanAgent />` in our React SDK) that provides a full chat interface for the fastest possible visual integration. It is a thin wrapper around the SDK.
