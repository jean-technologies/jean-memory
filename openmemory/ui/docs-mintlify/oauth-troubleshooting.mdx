## Two Authentication Flows

Jean Memory provides two distinct, secure OAuth 2.1 flows depending on your application's architecture.

<Card
  title="Frontend / Public Clients (e.g., React, Vue)"
  icon="browsers"
>
  This is the most common path for web applications. It uses the highly secure **OAuth 2.1 with PKCE** flow. Our React SDK and `<SignInWithJean />` component handle this automatically.
</Card>

<Card
  title="Backend / Confidential Clients (e.g., Python, Node.js)"
  icon="server"
>
  This is for server-to-server integrations. It uses the standard **OAuth 2.1 Authorization Code** flow. This is the recommended path for production backend services.
</Card>


## Understanding the Frontend (PKCE) Flow

This is the flow handled by our React SDK. Understanding the steps can help you troubleshoot issues.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### 1. Authorization Request
    Your app redirects the user to `https://jeanmemory.com/oauth/authorize` with your `client_id` and a `redirect_uri`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    #### 2. User Consent
    The user signs into their Jean Memory account and grants your application permission.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    #### 3. Redirect Back with Code
    We redirect the user back to the `redirect_uri` you provided, including a temporary authorization `code`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    #### 4. Token Exchange
    The Jean SDK securely exchanges the `code` for an `access_token` in the background.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Most Common Issue: "Invalid Redirect URI"

This error means the `redirect_uri` your application sent in Step 1 does **not exactly match** the URL registered for your API Key in our system.

### Troubleshooting Checklist

1.  **Check Your Jean Dashboard:**
    *   Go to the "Developers" section in your [Jean Memory dashboard](https://jeanmemory.com/dashboard).
    *   Find your SDK Key and look at the "Allowed Callback URLs" field.

2.  **Ensure an Exact Match:**
    *   The URI in your application code must be an **exact, character-for-character match** to one of the URLs in that list.
    *   **Common mistakes include:**
        *   `http://` vs. `https://`
        *   A trailing slash (`/`) at the end of one but not the other.
        *   `localhost` vs. `127.0.0.1`.

3.  **Local Development:**
    *   By default, all SDK keys are pre-configured with these callback URLs for local development:
        *   `http://localhost:3000/callback`
        *   `http://localhost:3001/callback`

4.  **Production Environments:**
    *   You must add your production callback URLs to the "Allowed Callback URLs" list in your Jean Memory dashboard.
    *   For example: `https://www.your-awesome-app.com/auth/callback`

<Warning>
**Security First:** For security, we require an exact match to prevent authorization codes from being intercepted by malicious actors.
</Warning>
