import { SignInWithJean } from 'jeanmemory-react';

Computers have no memory of their interactions with users. Every conversation starts from scratch. **Jean Memory solves this by creating a persistent, intelligent memory layer that makes AI truly personal.**

Our goal is to provide developers with the rich, personal context they need to make their AI applications truly intelligent. We are a specialized tool that integrates into your existing stack.

    subgraph "User's Applications"
        mobile["Mobile App<br/><i>React SDK</i>"];
        web["Web Dashboard<br/><i>React SDK</i>"];
        agent["Chat Agent<br/><i>Python SDK</i>"];
        api["API Service<br/><i>Node.js SDK</i>"];
    end

    subgraph "Jean Memory"
        memory["User's Shared Memory<br/><i>Conversations, Documents, Connections</i>"];
    end

    memory --> agent;
    memory --> api;

    class memory api;
    class mobile,web,agent,api read;
```

### How It Works

1.  **A User Signs Up:** The moment a user authenticates with your application via the secure `<SignInWithJean />` button, their memory graph is born.
2.  **Jean Starts Learning:** Jean immediately begins to learn from their conversations, automatically curating and saving important details in the background. This context is used to provide better, more relevant AI responses.
3.  **The User Connects More:** The user can optionally connect other data sources (like Notion, Slack, or Google Drive) to build a richer, more comprehensive memory.
