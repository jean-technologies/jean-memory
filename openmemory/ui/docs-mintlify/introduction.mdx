## What is Jean Memory & Why Does It Exist?

Jean Memory is an intelligent, persistent memory layer that sits between your application and an AI model. It ensures every interaction is informed by relevant, long-term user context.

**The Problem:** Today, your digital identity is fragmented across dozens of apps. This makes it impossible for AI to act as a truly helpful assistant because it lacks the context of who you are.

**The Solution:** Jean Memory breaks down these data silos by creating a unified, persistent memory layer. By integrating with Jean Memory, your application can access a rich, holistic understanding of the user, enabling truly personalized experiences.
