## What is Jean Memory?

**Jean Memory is a developer-first context engine that gives your AI application a perfect, long-term memory.**

Instead of just responding to one-off questions, your app can now understand, anticipate, and reason based on your user's entire history. We provide the rich, personal context that transforms a simple chatbot into a powerful copilot.

### How It Works

Jean sits between your application and your user's scattered data sources (like Notion, Slack, Google Drive, etc.), transforming a chaotic stream of information into a coherent block of context.

1.  **You Authenticate:** A user grants your app secure access to their memory via a simple, one-click OAuth flow.
2.  **We Engineer Context:** Our API searches the user's memory graph, ranks information for relevance, and assembles the perfect context for the task at hand.
3.  **You Build Intelligence:** We hand off a clean block of context to your backend. You combine it with your prompt and send it to your LLM of choice.

### Key Use Cases

With a powerful context engine, you can build next-generation AI applications:

-   **Agentic AI:** Build agents that can execute complex, multi-step tasks because they have the user's entire project history as context.
-   **Personalized Experiences:** Create an AI tutor that remembers a student's knowledge gaps or a financial advisor that understands a user's goals.
-   **Proactive Assistants:** Power AI that can anticipate a user's needs (e.g., *"I see you have a flight to London tomorrow, should I check for delays?"*) by having access to their calendar and travel history.

### The Gateway to Memory

Ready to get started? The `SignInWithJean` component is the simple, secure way to connect your users.

```jsx
import { SignInWithJean } from '@jeanmemory/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <SignInWithJean
      apiKey="YOUR_JEAN_SK_API_KEY"
      onSuccess={(user) => console.log('User authenticated!', user)}
    />
  );
}
```

This single component handles the entire authentication flow, allowing you to focus on building, not on boilerplate.
