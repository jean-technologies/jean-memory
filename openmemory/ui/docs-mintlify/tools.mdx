title: "Core Tools"
description: "A look at the lower-level, deterministic tools that power the Jean Memory engine."

import { Card } from 'mintlify/components';

While the main `getContext()` API is the recommended way to interact with Jean Memory, the platform is powered by a set of lower-level, deterministic tools. For advanced use cases where you need precise control, you can access these tools directly through our SDKs.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <Card
    title="add_memory"
    icon="plus"
  >
   Directly adds a new memory to the user's knowledge graph. This bypasses the AI-powered "Smart Triage" and ensures the memory is saved. Useful for explicit "remember this" functionality.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="search_memory"
    icon="search"
  >
    Performs a fast, targeted vector search (RAG) for the most relevant memories. This is the same tool used in the "fast path" of our `getContext` orchestrator and is ideal for quick, semantic lookups.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="deep_memory_query"
    icon="brain"
  >
    Initiates a deeper, more comprehensive query that traverses the knowledge graph to find connections and synthesize insights. This is a more powerful, and slower, query for when you need a comprehensive understanding of a topic.
  </Card>
