These are the primitive, low-level tools that our context engineering flows are built upon. While our primary `jean_memory` tool orchestrates these for you, they are directly callable for advanced use cases where you need precise, deterministic control over the memory layer.

### Document and Memory Tools

-   **`store_document(title, content)`**: Store large documents, files, or lengthy content. Perfect for saving meeting notes, documentation, or articles for future reference.
-   **`add_memories(text)`**: Manually stores specific information, bypassing the AI-powered "Smart Triage."
-   **`search_memory(query)`**: Performs a quick keyword search through your memories.
-   **`ask_memory(question)`**: Asks a simple question about your stored memories.
-   **`list_memories()`**: Browses through your stored memories.
-   **`deep_memory_query(query)`**: Performs a complex analysis across all of your memories to synthesize deeper insights.
