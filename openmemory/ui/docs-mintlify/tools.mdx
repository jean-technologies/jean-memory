title: "Core Tools"
description: "A look at the lower-level, deterministic tools that power the Jean Memory engine."

While the main `getContext()` API is the recommended way to interact with Jean Memory, the platform is powered by a set of lower-level, deterministic tools. These are the building blocks that our `Context Engineering` layer uses to perform its intelligent orchestration.

For advanced use cases where you need precise control, you can access these tools directly through our SDKs.

-   **`add_memories(text, [tags], [priority])`**: Directly adds a new memory to the user's knowledge graph. This bypasses the AI-powered "Smart Triage" and ensures the memory is saved. Useful for explicit "remember this" functionality.

-   **`search_memory(query, [limit], [tags_filter])`**: Performs a fast, targeted vector search (RAG) for the most relevant memories. This is the same tool used in the "fast path" of our `getContext` orchestrator and is ideal for quick, semantic lookups.
