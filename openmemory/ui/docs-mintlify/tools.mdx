Jean Memory’s core philosophy is **Context Engineering, not just Information Retrieval**. This means the system doesn't just store and retrieve memories—it intelligently engineers context for your AI assistant. Before every reply, it ensures it has all the relevant context needed, and it constantly saves new information to build a richer understanding over time.

This is made possible by a set of powerful, deterministic tools that act as the building blocks for our intelligent orchestration layer. While `jean_memory` is the primary tool for most interactions, you can use these lower-level tools for more granular control.

### Primary Tools

These are the essential tools for interacting with Jean Memory. For most use cases, these are all you will need.

-   **`jean_memory(user_message, is_new_conversation, needs_context)`**: The intelligent memory layer that automatically learns from every conversation and provides relevant context when you need it. Simply use this tool and Jean Memory handles everything else.
-   **`store_document(title, content)`**: Store large documents, files, or lengthy content. Perfect for saving meeting notes, documentation, or articles for future reference.

### Advanced Tools

For advanced use cases where you need precise, deterministic control over the memory layer.

-   **`search_memory(query)`**: Performs a quick keyword search through your memories.
-   **`ask_memory(question)`**: Asks a simple question about your stored memories.
-   **`add_memories(text)`**: Manually stores specific information, bypassing the AI-powered "Smart Triage."
-   **`list_memories()`**: Browses through your stored memories.
-   **`deep_memory_query(query)`**: Performs a complex analysis across all of your memories to synthesize deeper insights.
