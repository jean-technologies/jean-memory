    title="The Truly Agentic AI"

  >
    An AI agent's ability to perform complex, multi-step tasks is directly limited by the quality of its context. With Jean Memory, your agent has access to the user's entire project history, enabling it to reason and act with unprecedented intelligence.

    **Example:** An AI project manager that can autonomously draft a full project plan based on a user's scattered notes and previous conversations.

  >
    Imagine an AI tutor that remembers every one of a student's past questions, struggles, and successes. It could adapt its teaching style in real-time and create practice problems that target specific knowledge gaps.
    
    **Example:** An AI language tutor that notices a student consistently makes the same grammatical error and proactively creates a mini-lesson to address it.

  <Card
    title="The Proactive Personal Assistant"
    icon="user-shield"
  >
    By connecting to a user's calendar, email, and other data sources, a personal assistant powered by Jean Memory can move from being reactive to proactive. It can anticipate needs and offer help before the user even thinks to ask.

    **Example:** An AI assistant that sees an upcoming flight and proactively asks, "I see your flight to London is tomorrow. Would you like me to check for delays?"
