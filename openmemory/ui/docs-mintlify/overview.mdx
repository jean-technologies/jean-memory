## How Jean Memory Works

Jean Memory acts as an intelligent, persistent memory layer that sits between your application and an AI model. It ensures every interaction is informed by relevant, long-term user context. Our "Connect, Don't Collect" philosophy means users are always in control of their data.

## The Core Problem: Context is Siloed

Today, your digital identity is fragmented. Your professional life is on Slack and Linear, your social life on Instagram and X, and your personal thoughts in Notion or a journal.

Each application only sees a tiny, incomplete sliver of who you are. This makes it impossible for AI to act as a truly helpful assistant.

## The Solution: A Unified Memory Layer

Jean Memory breaks down these data silos by creating a unified, persistent memory layer. By integrating with Jean Memory, applications can access a rich, holistic understanding of the user, enabling them to:

-   **Personalize Experiences**: Adapt UI, recommendations, and content to individual preferences.
-   **Automate Tasks**: Act on the user's behalf with a deep understanding of their goals and habits.
-   **Provide Proactive Assistance**: Anticipate user needs before they're even expressed.

All of this is done with a user-centric approach that prioritizes privacy and control.

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Smart Triage">
    Not every piece of information is worth remembering. Jean Memory uses an AI-powered "Smart Triage" system to automatically decide what to save, filtering out noise and preserving only meaningful memories. This ensures the memory layer remains relevant and efficient.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Context Engineering">
    We go beyond simple information retrieval. Jean Memory actively "engineers" context by assembling and ranking insights from multiple memories, understanding relationships between concepts, and predicting what information will be most useful for a given task. This provides the AI model with actionable intelligence, not just raw data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Model Context Protocol (MCP)">
    MCP is our standardized protocol for the flow of context in and out of AI applications. It's the piping that makes seamless, cross-platform memory possible. While our SDKs provide a simpler high-level API, they are built on top of this powerful underlying protocol.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connect, Don't Collect">
    Our security and privacy philosophy. Users establish their identity with Jean Memory and then connect external services via secure OAuth 2.1 flows. We never see or store their credentials for other platforms, and users have a central place to manage all their connected memory sources.
