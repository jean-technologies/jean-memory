## 1. Get Your API Key

            }, 2000);
          });
        })
        .catch(err => {
          console.error('Failed to copy: ', err);
          btn.innerHTML = 'Failed to copy';
          setTimeout(() => {
            btn.innerHTML = 'Copy All Docs for AI';
          }, 2000);
        });
    }}

First, you'll need a Jean Memory SDK key.

1.  Sign in to your [Jean Memory dashboard](https://jeanmemory.com/dashboard).
2.  Navigate to the **Developers** section in the sidebar.
3.  Create a new SDK key. It will be prefixed with `jean_sk_...`.
4.  Copy the key and keep it somewhere safe. You'll need it in the next step.

## 2. Install the React SDK

Our React SDK is the fastest way to get a full-featured, memory-enabled chatbot running in your application. We recommend starting here.

```bash
npm install jeanmemory-react
```

## 3. Add the JeanAgent Component

The `<JeanAgent />` component is an all-in-one solution that handles authentication, chat UI, and state management. Just pass it your API key.

```tsx {{ title: 'src/App.tsx' }}
import { JeanAgent } from 'jeanmemory-react';
import 'jeanmemory-react/dist/style.css'; // Optional: for default styling

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: '600px', width: '400px', margin: 'auto' }}>
      <JeanAgent apiKey="YOUR_JEAN_SK_API_KEY" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

That's it! You now have a fully functional, context-aware AI chatbot in your React application. When a user interacts with it for the first time, they will be guided through a secure "Sign In with Jean" flow.

<Card
  title="What's happening under the hood?"
  icon="rocket"
>
  The `<JeanAgent />` component uses our powerful `useJeanAgent` hook to orchestrate the entire experience. It displays a secure `<SignInWithJean />` button that uses an OAuth 2.1 PKCE flow. Once authenticated, each message is sent to the Jean Memory backend to be enhanced with the user's personal context before being sent to the LLM.
