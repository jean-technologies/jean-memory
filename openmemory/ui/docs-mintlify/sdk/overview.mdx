    **For the Frontend.** The React SDK is designed for building user-facing components. It includes the `<JeanChat />` appliance for instant setup and the `useJean` hook for building custom UIs. Its main job is to handle the UI and secure user authentication.

    **For the Backend.** The Node.js SDK is a headless library for your server. It's built to be used in API routes and serverless functions to fetch context for your LLM calls. It's the bridge between your application logic and the Jean Memory engine.
