## The Two-Layer SDK Model

To support both headless and UI-based integrations, our SDKs are designed with a modular, two-layer architecture. This allows you to choose the perfect level of abstraction for your project.

  href="/sdk/nodejs">
  A headless, UI-agnostic library that provides direct access to our Context API. Its primary method is `getContext()`. This is the product for most backend developers who want to integrate Jean's context into their existing agents or LLM calls.

<Card
  title="The UI SDK (e.g., @jeanmemory/react)"
  icon="react"
  href="/sdk/react">
  An optional wrapper around the Core SDK that provides pre-built React components like `<JeanProvider>` and `<JeanChat />` for the fastest possible visual integration. It's the perfect choice for developers who want a "Chatbase-like" experience out of the box.
