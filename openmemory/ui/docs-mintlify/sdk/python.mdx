## Installation

```bash
pip install jeanmemory
```

## Core SDK Usage

The Python SDK allows you to interact with the Jean Memory context engine from your backend services. Its primary purpose is to get context that you can then use in your own prompts with your own LLM.

### 1. Initialize the Agent

First, create an instance of the `JeanAgentMCP`, providing your API key.

```python
from jeanmemory import JeanAgentMCP

agent = JeanAgentMCP(
    api_key="YOUR_JEAN_SK_API_KEY"
)
```

### 2. Authenticate a User

Before you can process messages, you must have an authenticated user. 

```python
# NOTE: This direct email/password method is a convenience for local 
# development and testing. For production applications, you should implement 
# a secure server-to-server OAuth 2.1 flow.
agent.authenticate(
    email="user@example.com", 
    password="user_password"
)
```

### 3. Get Context for a Message

Now you can get context for any user message. This is the core function of the SDK.

```python
# This is the primary method of the SDK
context = agent.get_context(
    "What were we just talking about?"
)

# Now, you can use this context in your own prompt to your own LLM
print(f"Retrieved Context: {context}")
```

## All-in-One Chat (Convenience Method)

For quick testing or simple applications, the SDK also provides an all-in-one `send_message` method that handles both getting context and calling the LLM to get a final response.

```python
response = agent.send_message(
    "Remind me that I need to prepare for the board meeting tomorrow."
)

print(f"Assistant: {response}")
```

## Storing Documents

You can also programmatically add documents to a user's memory.

```python
agent.store_document(
    title="Important Meeting Prep",
    content="The board meeting is at 10 AM. Key topics are Q3 financials and the Project Alpha launch."
)
```
