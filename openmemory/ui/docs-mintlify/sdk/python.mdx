The Jean Memory Python SDK provides a simple, headless interface to our powerful Context API. It's designed to be integrated directly into your backend services, AI agents, or data processing pipelines.

## Installation

```bash
pip install jeanmemory
```

## Usage: Adding Context to an Agent

The primary use case for the Python SDK is to retrieve context that you can then inject into a prompt for your chosen Large Language Model.

The example below shows a typical workflow where we get context from Jean Memory before calling the OpenAI API.

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from jeanmemory import JeanClient

# 1. Initialize the clients
jean = JeanClient(api_key=os.environ.get("JEAN_API_KEY"))
openai = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# 2. Get the user token from your frontend
# This token is securely obtained via the OAuth flow handled by
# our frontend components, like @jeanmemory/react.
user_token = get_user_token_from_request() 

# 3. Get context from Jean Memory
user_message = "What were the key takeaways from our last meeting about Project Phoenix?"
context_response = jean.get_context(
    user_token=user_token,
    message=user_message
)

# 4. Engineer your final prompt
final_prompt = f"""
Using the following context, please answer the user's question.
The context is a summary of the user's memories related to their question.

Context:
---
{context_response.text}
---

User Question: {user_message}
"""

# 5. Call your LLM
completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": final_prompt},
    ],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)

```

### A Note on Authentication

The `user_token` is the critical piece that connects a request to a specific user's memory. In a production application, your frontend should use our React SDK's `<SignInWithJean />` component (or a manual OAuth 2.1 PKCE flow) to authenticate the user and receive this token. Your frontend then passes this token to your backend, which uses it to make authenticated requests with the Python SDK.

For information on implementing a secure server-to-server OAuth flow for backend services, see the [Authentication](/authentication) guide.

## Advanced: Direct Tool Access

For advanced use cases, the `JeanClient` also provides a `tools` namespace for direct, deterministic access to the core memory functions.

```python
# The intelligent, orchestrated way:
context = jean.get_context(user_token=..., message="...")

# The deterministic, tool-based way:
jean.tools.add_memory(
    user_token=..., 
    content="My favorite color is blue."
)

search_results = jean.tools.search_memory(
    user_token=...,
    query="what are my preferences?"
)
```
