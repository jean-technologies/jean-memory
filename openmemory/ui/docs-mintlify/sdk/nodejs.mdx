## Installation

```bash
npm install jeanmemory-node
```

## Core SDK Usage (Headless)

The Jean Memory Node.js SDK is designed primarily for backend services. Its purpose is to act as a secure, server-side "context engine." You send it a user's message, and it returns the rich, relevant context from that user's memory. You then pass this context, along with your own system prompt, to your preferred LLM.

```javascript {{ title: 'server.js' }}
import { JeanAgent } from 'jeanmemory-node';

const agent = new JeanAgent({ apiKey: process.env.JEAN_API_KEY });

async function getContextForUser(message, userToken) {
  // The process method gets the context and returns a streamable response
  // that can be piped or converted to text.
  const stream = await agent.process(message, userToken);
  
  // You would then take this context and use it in your own LLM prompt.
  return stream;
}
```

### Authentication

The Node.js SDK is designed to work in tandem with a frontend client. It expects that the user has already authenticated using a frontend SDK (like our React SDK) and has received a JWT. The client should send this JWT in the `Authorization` header of its request to your backend.

## Quick Start: Next.js API Route

For convenience, the SDK provides a `createJeanHandler` function that creates a complete, production-ready API endpoint for Next.js. This handler performs both the context retrieval *and* the final LLM call.

```typescript {{ title: '/pages/api/chat.ts' }}
import { createJeanHandler } from 'jeanmemory-node';

// This handler is compatible with the Vercel AI SDK and edge runtimes
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

// This one line creates the entire API endpoint
export default createJeanHandler({
  apiKey: process.env.JEAN_API_KEY,
  systemPrompt: 'You are a financial advisor who uses personal context to give better advice.'
});
