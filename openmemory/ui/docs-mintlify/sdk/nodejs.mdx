The Jean Memory Node.js SDK is a headless library for integrating our Context API into your backend services. It's perfect for developers building API routes, serverless functions, or stateful agents in a Node.js environment.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @jeanmemory/node
```

## Usage: Creating a Context-Aware API Route

A common use case is to create an API endpoint that your frontend can call. This endpoint will securely fetch context from Jean Memory and then stream a response from your chosen LLM.

The example below shows how to create a Next.js API route that is compatible with edge runtimes and the Vercel AI SDK.

```typescript {{ title: 'pages/api/chat.ts' }}
import { JeanClient } from '@jeanmemory/node';
import { OpenAIStream, StreamingTextResponse } from 'ai';
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Create the clients
const jean = new JeanClient({ apiKey: process.env.JEAN_API_KEY });
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

// Set the runtime to edge for best performance
export const runtime = 'edge';

export default async function POST(req: Request) {
  // 1. Get the user's message and token from the request body
  const { messages, userToken } = await req.json();
  const currentMessage = messages[messages.length - 1].content;

  // Ensure the user token is present
  if (!userToken) {
    return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
  }

  // 2. Get context from Jean Memory
  const contextResponse = await jean.getContext({
    user_token: userToken,
    message: currentMessage,
  });

  // 3. Engineer your final prompt
  const finalPrompt = `
    Using the following context, please answer the user's question.
    The context is a summary of the user's memories related to their question.

    Context:
    ---
    ${contextResponse.text}
    ---

    User Question: ${currentMessage}
  `;
  
  // 4. Call your LLM and stream the response
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4-turbo',
    stream: true,
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
      { role: "user", content: finalPrompt },
    ],
  });

  const stream = OpenAIStream(response);
  return new StreamingTextResponse(stream);
}
```

### Authentication Flow

As with the Python SDK, the `userToken` is obtained by your frontend application through a secure OAuth 2.1 flow using our `@jeanmemory/react` SDK. Your frontend makes an authenticated request to this API route, including the `userToken` in the request body. See the [Authentication](/authentication) guide for more details.

## Advanced: Direct Tool Access

For advanced use cases, the `JeanClient` also provides a `tools` namespace for direct, deterministic access to the core memory functions.

```typescript
// The intelligent, orchestrated way:
const context = await jean.getContext({ user_token: ..., message: "..." });

// The deterministic, tool-based way:
await jean.tools.add_memory({
    user_token: ..., 
    content: "My project's deadline is next Friday."
});

const search_results = await jean.tools.search_memory({
    user_token: ...,
    query: "project deadlines"
});
```
