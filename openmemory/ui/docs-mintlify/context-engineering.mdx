## Context Engineering, Not Information Retrieval

Jean Memory's core philosophy is **Context Engineering**, not just Information Retrieval. This means the system doesn't just store and retrieve memories—it intelligently engineers context for your AI assistant. This is the key to making AI truly personal and useful.

The system is designed to:
-   Select the *right* information at the *right* time.
-   Synthesize insights from disparate memories.
-   Understand relationships between memories.
-   Predict what context will be most useful.

This is a continuous process. Memories are constantly being saved and analyzed in the background. When a query comes in, the system intelligently decides whether new context is required and, if so, what depth of search is necessary to provide the most relevant response.

## The Orchestration Engine

The `jean_memory` API is the heart of the system. It's the primary interface for your AI to interact with the memory layer, orchestrating various underlying functions to provide the right context at the right depth.

    class write_processor,add_memory,store_document write;
    class search_memory_shallow,search_memory_deep,deep_memory_query tools;
```

### Context Strategies

The orchestrator uses different strategies to create the best possible context for the AI.

1.  **`deep_understanding`**: Used for new conversations to provide comprehensive context about the user.
2.  **`relevant_context`**: Used for ongoing conversations to provide targeted, relevant information.
3.  **`comprehensive_analysis`**: Used for deep queries like "tell me everything you know about X" to do a full scan of all available information.

### Opinionated Context Flows

While our primary `jean_memory` tool provides a balanced approach, the underlying tools can be composed into highly specialized, opinionated flows to solve specific problems. A strong opinion is what separates a simple tool from a powerful platform.

Below are a few examples of what's possible, designed to be both high-value and to demonstrate a clear, opinionated approach to context engineering.

<Card title="Flow 1: Strategic Relationship Management">
  <p>This flow moves beyond simple fact recall ("What is Jane's title?") to providing actionable intelligence. It's for a professional who needs to prepare for a key meeting by understanding the deep context of a relationship, including past conversations, unresolved issues, and shared connections.</p>

### Create Your Own Flow

The true power of Jean Memory is its flexibility. The primitive tools (`store_document`, `search_memory`, `add_memories`, etc.) are the building blocks for you to create your own context engineering flows tailored to your specific use case.

Whether you're building a hyper-personalized tutor, a strategic research agent, or something entirely new, our toolset provides the foundation.
