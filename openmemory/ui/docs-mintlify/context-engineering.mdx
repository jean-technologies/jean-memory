## The Core Philosophy: Engineering, Not Retrieval

Jean Memory's power doesn't come from just storing and retrieving data—it comes from **Context Engineering**.

This is the sophisticated process of selecting the *right* information at the *right* time, synthesizing insights from disparate memories, and predicting what context will be most useful for your AI. This is what allows an application to feel truly personal and intelligent.

This approach is inspired by Rich Sutton's "The Bitter Lesson," which argues that general-purpose methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective. We use AI to decide what to remember, what context is relevant, and how to create new insights automatically.

## The Context API: An Engine of Engines

When your application calls `jean.getContext()`, it's not just fetching a document. It's kicking off a powerful orchestration process managed by our Context API. This API is an "engine of engines" that intelligently manages multiple underlying services to build the perfect context.

### The Dual-Path Process

To ensure a fast user experience while performing deep analysis, the process is split:

1.  **Immediate Path (< 3 seconds):** When your request hits our API, we instantly perform a fast vector search to get the most relevant context and return it to you immediately. Your user never waits.

2.  **Background Path (Asynchronous):**
    *   **Smart Triage:** In the background, a fast AI model (like Gemini Flash) analyzes every user message to decide if it's meaningful enough to be saved as a new memory. This prevents "clutter."
    *   **Deep Analysis:** For complex queries, the engine might also kick off a deeper analysis, traversing our knowledge graph to find hidden relationships and create new, high-level "insight memories" that will be available for future queries.

### Context Strategies

The `SmartContextOrchestrator` is the brain behind the API. It intelligently chooses from several strategies to build the best context for any situation:

*   **`deep_understanding`:** Used for new conversations to provide a comprehensive overview of a user and their history.
*   **`relevant_context`:** The standard mode for ongoing conversations, providing targeted, relevant information based on the immediate conversational history.
*   **`comprehensive_analysis`:** Used for deep queries like "tell me everything you know about X" to do a full scan of all available information.

## Your Logic, Our Engine

While we provide powerful, pre-built context strategies, we understand that advanced applications have unique needs. Our platform is built to be extensible.

**We are currently developing capabilities to allow developers to define their own custom context engineering flows.**

If you have a unique challenge that requires a bespoke context strategy—such as a specific way of ranking financial data or a custom logic for educational content—please reach out to our solutions team. We are actively looking for partners to help us build the future of context engineering.
