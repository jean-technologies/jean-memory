## Our Philosophy: Secure by Design

Jean Memory handles sensitive personal data, and we take that responsibility seriously. That's why we've built our authentication system on the industry-standard **OAuth 2.1 protocol**. This ensures that user credentials are never shared with third-party applications and that users have full control over who can access their memory.

**The best part? All this security is completely invisible to developers.** Our SDK handles OAuth 2.1 PKCE, JWT tokens, session persistence, and universal identity mapping automatically. You get enterprise-grade security with a 5-line integration.

We provide two clear authentication flows to support different types of applications.

## Flow 1: Browser-Based Apps (PKCE Grant)

This flow is designed for frontend applications (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) running in a user's browser. It uses the **Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)** grant type, which is the current best practice for securing public clients.

### Universal Identity System

Jean Memory now features a universal identity system that ensures users maintain the same identity across all applications and sessions. When a user signs in with their email (via Google, GitHub, or email auth), they are mapped to a single, permanent user ID. This means:

- **Consistent Identity**: Users keep the same memories across different apps using Jean Memory
- **Provider Flexibility**: Users can sign in with any supported provider and access the same account
- **Cross-Platform**: The same user account works on web, mobile, and desktop applications

### The Easy Way: 5 Lines of Code

For React developers, we've made this incredibly simple. Our SDK handles the entire OAuth 2.1 PKCE flow automatically, including session persistence and user identity management.

```jsx
import { JeanProvider, SignInWithJean, useJean } from '@jeanmemory/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <JeanProvider apiKey="jean_sk_your_api_key">
      <SignInWithJean onSuccess={(user) => console.log('Authenticated!')}>
        Sign In with Jean
      </SignInWithJean>
      <YourApp />
    </JeanProvider>
  );
}

function YourApp() {
  const { sendMessage, isAuthenticated, user } = useJean();

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <div>Please sign in to continue</div>;
  }

  const handleChat = async () => {
    // Automatically uses authenticated user's context and memories
    const response = await sendMessage("What did I work on yesterday?");
    console.log(response);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {user.name}!</h1>
      <button onClick={handleChat}>Ask about my work</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**What happens automatically:**
- **OAuth 2.1 PKCE Flow**: Secure authentication with Google (no client secrets needed)
- **Session Persistence**: Users stay logged in across browser refreshes and tabs
- **Universal Identity**: Same user account across all Jean Memory applications
- **Automatic API Requests**: All memory queries include user context automatically
- **Error Recovery**: Handles token expiration and network issues gracefully

When a user clicks "Sign In with Jean", they are redirected to Google OAuth, authenticate securely, and return to your app with a persistent session. No complex token management or API calls required on your end.

## Flow 2: Backend Services (Authorization Code Grant)

This flow is for trusted backend services that need to access a user's memory on their behalf, even when the user is not actively present (e.g., for a background data sync). It uses the standard **Authorization Code Grant**.

This is a more involved flow that requires server-side handling of secrets.

### High-Level Steps

1.  **User Authorization:** Your application redirects the user to the Jean Memory authorization URL with your `client_id` and a `redirect_uri`.
2.  **Grant Authorization Code:** The user logs in and approves the request. Jean Memory redirects back to your `redirect_uri` with a temporary `code`.
3.  **Exchange Code for Token:** Your backend service makes a secure, server-to-server request to the Jean Memory token endpoint, exchanging the `code` (along with your `client_id` and `client_secret`) for an `access_token` and a `refresh_token`.
4.  **Access API:** Your service can now use the `access_token` to make authenticated requests to the Jean Memory API on the user's behalf.
5.  **Refresh Token:** When the `access_token` expires, use the `refresh_token` to obtain a new one without requiring the user to log in again.

<Info>
  **Getting Credentials:** The server-to-server flow is intended for trusted partners and high-volume applications. Please contact our team to discuss your use case and receive a `client_id` and `client_secret`.
