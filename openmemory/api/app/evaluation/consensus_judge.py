"""
Consensus LLM Judge System
=========================

Implements multi-LLM consensus judging with parallel execution, outlier detection,
and intelligent fallback to meet 100% FRD compliance for Task 2.

Key Features:
- Parallel execution of multiple LLM judges
- Configurable consensus modes (single, dual, triple)
- Outlier detection and handling
- Consensus score averaging across all dimensions
- Intelligent fallback chains
- Enhanced metadata storage with individual judge scores
