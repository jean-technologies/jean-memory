## Notes for Implementation

1. **Start with Task 1** - Immediate impact, zero risk
2. **Implement Task 2 & 3 in parallel** - Different developers
3. **Task 6 is critical** - Must monitor memory with 50-100 users
4. **Plan Qdrant upgrade early** - Don't wait for degradation
5. **Keep 200MB emergency reserve** - Never exceed 90% memory

This plan fully leverages your 2GB upgrade while maintaining stability for 50-100 concurrent users.
