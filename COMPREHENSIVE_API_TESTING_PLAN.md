# Jean Memory API & SDK Comprehensive Testing Plan

**Date:** August 8, 2025  
**Status:** 🧪 **CRITICAL PRE-LAUNCH VALIDATION**  
**Priority:** P0 - Launch Blocker  
**Integration:** Supports SIGN_IN_WITH_JEAN_ACTION_PLAN_V4_REVAMPED.md

---

## 🎯 **TESTING MISSION STATEMENT**

**Goal:** Robustly validate that Jean Memory SDK and API work exactly as documented before the 48-hour launch window.

**Critical Issues Identified:**
1. **Test app is outdated** - Using old SDK version (0.1.0 vs 0.1.3) and wrong imports
2. **Jean Memory tool depth issue** - Sometimes calls medium depth but returns no context 
3. **Documentation vs Reality gap** - Need to validate all documented features actually work
4. **OAuth flow end-to-end** - Critical blocker from V4 plan needs validation

---

## 🏗️ **TESTING ARCHITECTURE**

### **Phase 1: SDK Testing Foundation (Day 1)**
Fix and validate the basic SDK integration before testing advanced features.

### **Phase 2: Jean Memory Tool Deep Testing (Day 2)**  
Systematically test the `jean_memory` tool's context retrieval logic across all depth levels.

### **Phase 3: Production Readiness Validation (Day 3)**
End-to-end testing of all documented features with real user scenarios.

---

## 📋 **PHASE 1: SDK TESTING FOUNDATION**

### **1.1 Fix Test React App (Priority: P0)**

**Current Issues:**
```yaml
PROBLEM: test-react-app is using outdated SDK
- Package: jeanmemory-react-0.1.0.tgz (should be 0.1.3 from npm)
- Imports: Custom components instead of published SDK
- Auth: Email/password instead of OAuth 2.1 PKCE
```

**Actions Required:**
```bash
# 1. Update to published SDK
cd test-react-app
npm uninstall jeanmemory-react
npm install jeanmemory-react@0.1.3

# 2. Fix imports in pages/index.tsx
- Remove: import { useJeanAgent, SignInWithJean, JeanChat } from '../components/useJeanAgent'  
+ Add: import { useJean, SignInWithJean, JeanChat } from 'jeanmemory-react'

# 3. Update hook usage
- Remove: useJeanAgent
+ Add: useJean
```

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] **TC-1.1:** Fresh npm install works without errors
- [ ] **TC-1.2:** All SDK components import correctly
- [ ] **TC-1.3:** TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] **TC-1.4:** Development server starts without errors

### **1.2 OAuth 2.1 PKCE Flow Validation (Priority: P0)**

**From V4 Action Plan - Critical Blocker:**
```yaml
CURRENT: {"detail":"Invalid redirect URI"}  
TARGET: Working end-to-end OAuth flow
```

**⚠️ OAuth Complexity Reality Check:**
```yaml
CHALLENGE: OAuth is complex for average developers/businesses
- Backend token validation requires complex server setup
- Browser token validation is simpler but needs careful implementation
- Don't want to break current working setup
- Must remain "easy and additive" not "complex system overhaul"

APPROACH: Pragmatic OAuth Implementation
1. FIRST: Fix redirect URI issue (simple server config)
2. THEN: Browser token validation (client-side JWT decode)
3. FALLBACK: Keep existing auth methods working
4. PRINCIPLE: "OAuth enhances, doesn't replace" current system
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
```yaml
PHASE A: Quick Fix (30 minutes)
- Fix server redirect URI whitelist
- Test basic OAuth redirect flow
- Validate redirect back to app works

PHASE B: Browser Token Validation (2 hours)  
- Implement client-side JWT token decode
- Add token expiry handling
- Maintain backwards compatibility

PHASE C: Graceful Fallbacks (1 hour)
- Ensure existing auth methods still work
- Add clear error messages for OAuth failures
- Document both auth paths for developers
```

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] **TC-1.5:** SignInWithJean button renders correctly
- [ ] **TC-1.6:** Click redirects to Jean Memory OAuth  
- [ ] **TC-1.7:** OAuth consent screen appears
- [ ] **TC-1.8:** Grant permission succeeds
- [ ] **TC-1.9:** Redirect back to app with auth token
- [ ] **TC-1.10:** Browser validates token correctly (client-side)
- [ ] **TC-1.11:** User state persists across page refresh
- [ ] **TC-1.12:** Fallback auth still works if OAuth fails
- [ ] **TC-1.13:** Clear error messages for OAuth failures

### **1.3 Basic Chat Integration (Priority: P0)**

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] **TC-1.11:** JeanChat component renders after auth
- [ ] **TC-1.12:** User can type messages
- [ ] **TC-1.13:** Messages send without errors
- [ ] **TC-1.14:** AI responses are received
- [ ] **TC-1.15:** Conversation history persists

---

## 🧠 **PHASE 2: JEAN MEMORY TOOL DEEP TESTING**

### **2.1 Context Retrieval Depth Analysis**

**Known Issue:** "jean memory tool itself is not perfect and doesnt always call the correct depth of memory search and sometimes it may call the medium depth for instance and doesnt return any context."

**Test Scenarios:**

#### **Scenario A: New User (No Context)**
```yaml
SETUP: Brand new user with no memory history
INPUT: "Hello, I'm new here"
EXPECTED: 
  - Tool calls shallow depth (or no search)
  - Returns friendly onboarding response
  - No errors about missing context
TEST: TC-2.1
```

#### **Scenario B: Light Context Available**
```yaml  
SETUP: User with 1-3 previous conversations
INPUT: "What did we talk about last time?"
EXPECTED:
  - Tool calls appropriate depth (light/medium)
  - Returns relevant context from previous conversations
  - Context is actually useful/relevant
TEST: TC-2.2
```

#### **Scenario C: Rich Context Available**
```yaml
SETUP: User with 10+ conversations across multiple topics  
INPUT: "Help me with the project we discussed"
EXPECTED:
  - Tool calls deep search if needed
  - Returns comprehensive relevant context
  - Context synthesis is coherent
TEST: TC-2.3
```

#### **Scenario D: Medium Depth Failure Case**
```yaml
SETUP: Reproduce the "medium depth returns no context" bug
INPUT: Various queries that should trigger medium depth
EXPECTED: 
  - Identify when medium depth fails
  - Document exact failure conditions
  - Propose fixes for depth selection logic
TEST: TC-2.4 (Bug Reproduction)
```

### **2.2 Jean Memory Tool Parameters Testing**

**Test Tool Call Variations:**
```javascript
// Test different parameter combinations
await callJeanMemoryTool({
  user_message: "test message",
  is_new_conversation: true/false,
  needs_context: true/false,
  depth: "light"|"medium"|"deep", // if parameter exists
  user_id: "test-user"
});
```

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] **TC-2.5:** Tool with is_new_conversation: true
- [ ] **TC-2.6:** Tool with is_new_conversation: false  
- [ ] **TC-2.7:** Tool with needs_context: false
- [ ] **TC-2.8:** Tool with needs_context: true
- [ ] **TC-2.9:** Tool parameter validation errors
- [ ] **TC-2.10:** Tool response format validation

### **2.3 Context Engineering Quality Tests**

**Evaluate context usefulness:**
- [ ] **TC-2.11:** Context relevance scoring (manual evaluation)
- [ ] **TC-2.12:** Context freshness (recent vs old memories)
- [ ] **TC-2.13:** Context completeness (full conversations vs fragments)
- [ ] **TC-2.14:** Context synthesis quality (coherent narrative vs random facts)

## ⚡ **PHASE 3: PRODUCTION READINESS VALIDATION**

### **3.1 End-to-End User Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Math Tutor Demo**
```yaml
USER JOURNEY:
1. Visit test app → Click "Math Tutor Demo"
2. Sign in with Jean Memory → Complete OAuth flow
3. Ask: "Can you help me with calculus?"
4. Have conversation about derivatives
5. Refresh page → Ask: "What were we discussing about calculus?"
6. Validate: Context from step 4 is recalled correctly

TEST CASES: TC-3.1 through TC-3.6
```

**Scenario 2: Personal Assistant Demo**  
```yaml
USER JOURNEY:
1. Sign in → Tell assistant about personal preferences
2. Ask for recommendations based on preferences  
3. Sign out and sign back in different session
4. Validate: Previous preferences are remembered
5. Cross-app test: Use same account in different demo

TEST CASES: TC-3.7 through TC-3.12
```

### **3.2 Cross-Application Memory Persistence**

**Critical Feature Test:**
- [ ] **TC-3.13:** Create memory in Math Tutor app
- [ ] **TC-3.14:** Access same memory in Personal Assistant app  
- [ ] **TC-3.15:** Validate cross-app context synthesis
- [ ] **TC-3.16:** Test memory isolation between different users

### **3.3 Error Handling & Edge Cases**

**Network & API Failures:**
- [ ] **TC-3.17:** Offline behavior (graceful degradation)
- [ ] **TC-3.18:** API timeout handling
- [ ] **TC-3.19:** Invalid API key error messages
- [ ] **TC-3.20:** OAuth failure recovery
- [ ] **TC-3.21:** Memory service unavailable fallback

**User Experience Edge Cases:**
- [ ] **TC-3.22:** Very long conversations (>100 messages)
- [ ] **TC-3.23:** Rapid message sending (rate limiting)
- [ ] **TC-3.24:** Special characters and emoji handling
- [ ] **TC-3.25:** Multi-language support
