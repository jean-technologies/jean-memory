# Documentation Review: Current State & Path Forward

This document provides a high-level summary and assessment of all key documentation assets for the Jean Memory project. Its purpose is to guide our review and identify areas for improvement.

---

### 1. Production Developer Docs (`openmemory/ui/docs-mintlify/`)

*   **What It Is:** This is your public-facing, official documentation for developers, hosted at `docs.jeanmemory.com`. This is where we have been focusing our recent efforts.
*   **What's Good:**
    *   **Strategically Aligned:** The content is now strongly aligned with the "headless context engine" philosophy.
    *   **Well-Structured:** The navigation is clear (Quickstart, SDKs, Core Concepts, etc.).
    *   **High-Value Content:** The "Opinionated Flows" and detailed SDK explanations provide significant value to developers.
*   **What Needs Improvement:**
    *   **Minor:** While good, we could consider adding even more diagrams to other sections (like Authentication) to make complex topics more accessible at a glance.

**Verdict:** Excellent shape. This is the gold standard for the project.

### 2. Root Project `README.md`

*   **What It Is:** The main entry point for anyone landing on the GitHub repository.
*   **What's Good:**
    *   It provides very detailed, step-by-step instructions for getting a local development environment running.
*   **What Needs Improvement:**
    *   **It is not a good "front door."** It immediately dives into technical setup, which can be alienating for non-developers or those trying to quickly understand the project's purpose.
    *   **Misaligned with Strategy:** It doesn't communicate the high-level vision of a "headless context engine." It makes the project seem like just a complex open-source tool to set up.

**Verdict:** This is the weakest link. It needs to be completely rewritten to serve as a high-level introduction to the project, its philosophy, and where to find other resources (like the Mintlify docs).

### 3. SDK `README.md` Files (`sdk/`, `sdk/react/`, `sdk/python/`, `sdk/node/`)

*   **What They Are:** Individual READMEs within each SDK package, primarily for developers who find the package on npm or PyPI.
*   **What's Good:**
    *   They are concise and provide immediate, copy-pasteable quickstart examples.
*   **What Needs Improvement:**
    *   **Inconsistent:** The tone, style, and structure vary between them. For example, the root `sdk/README.md` presents a different code example than the `sdk/react/README.md`.
    *   **Redundancy:** There's significant overlap between them.

**Verdict:** Good, but could be great. We should standardize these to provide a consistent developer experience, regardless of the language they choose.

### Summary & Recommendations

1.  **Celebrate the Win:** The Mintlify docs are now in a fantastic state and correctly represent the product vision.
2.  **Immediate Priority:** The root `README.md` needs a complete overhaul. It should become a high-level, strategic document that welcomes visitors and directs them, rather than a technical setup guide. The setup guide can be moved to a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a "Local Development" page in the Mintlify docs.
3.  **Next Step:** After fixing the root `README.md`, we should conduct a quick pass on the SDK READMEs to standardize their structure and ensure they all align with the latest messaging.
