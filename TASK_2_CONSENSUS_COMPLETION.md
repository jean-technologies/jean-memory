## üî¨ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS**

### **Parallel Judge Execution**
```python
# Execute multiple judges simultaneously
async def _execute_parallel_judging(self, context, providers):
    tasks = [evaluate_single_judge(p) for p in providers]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    return [r for r in results if isinstance(r, IndividualJudgeResult)]
```

### **Outlier Detection**
```python
# Statistical outlier detection
def _detect_and_handle_outliers(self, results):
    scores = [r.score.overall for r in results]
    mean_score = statistics.mean(scores)
    std_dev = statistics.stdev(scores)
    threshold = self.config["outlier_threshold"]
    
    outliers = []
    for result in results:
        z_score = abs(result.score.overall - mean_score) / std_dev
        if z_score > threshold:
            outliers.append(result.provider)
```

### **Consensus Score Calculation**
```python
# Weighted consensus across all dimensions
def _calculate_consensus_scores(self, results):
    consensus = {
        "relevance": statistics.mean([r.score.relevance for r in results]),
        "completeness": statistics.mean([r.score.completeness for r in results]),
        "reasoning_quality": statistics.mean([r.score.reasoning_quality for r in results]),
        "consistency": statistics.mean([r.score.consistency for r in results if r.score.consistency > 0])
    }
    # Weighted overall using same weights as base judge
    consensus["overall"] = self._calculate_weighted_overall(consensus)
```

### **Intelligent Fallback**
```python
# Multi-level fallback system
async def evaluate_context(self, context, consensus_mode=None):
    try:
        return await self._consensus_evaluation(context, consensus_mode)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Consensus failed: {e}")
        return await self._fallback_to_single_judge(context)
```

## üìä **CONSENSUS SYSTEM USAGE**

### **Basic Consensus Evaluation**
```python
from app.evaluation import evaluate_with_consensus, ConsensusMode

# Triple-judge consensus
score = await evaluate_with_consensus(
    query="What are my hobbies?",
    memories=["User enjoys reading", "Plays guitar", "Likes hiking"],
    response="You enjoy reading, playing guitar, and hiking.",
    consensus_mode=ConsensusMode.TRIPLE
)

print(f"Consensus Score: {score.overall:.1f}/10")
print(f"Judge Agreement: {score.reliability_score:.2f}")
print(f"Judges Used: {[p.value for p in score.judges_used]}")
print(f"Outliers: {[p.value for p in score.outliers_detected]}")
```

### **Consensus vs Single Judge Comparison**
```python
from app.evaluation import compare_consensus_vs_single

comparison = await compare_consensus_vs_single(
    query="Complex multi-hop question",
    memories=["Memory 1", "Memory 2", "Memory 3"],
    response="Generated response"
)

print(f"Single Judge: {comparison['single_judge']['score']:.1f}")
print(f"Consensus: {comparison['consensus_judge']['score']:.1f}")
print(f"Variance Reduction: {comparison['consensus_judge']['variance']:.3f}")
print(f"Reliability: {comparison['consensus_judge']['reliability']:.2f}")
```

### **Integration with Existing Decorators**
```python
# Automatic consensus evaluation
@evaluate_with_judge(name="my_function", capture_result=True)
async def generate_context(query, memories):
    return {
        "query": query,
        "memories": memories,
        "response": "Generated response"
    }
# Consensus evaluation triggered automatically if enabled
```
