# ChatGPT SSE Connection Status

## Current Situation

### ‚úÖ Existing Cloudflare Worker
There's already a Cloudflare Worker deployed at:
- Repository: https://github.com/jean-technologies/sse-worker
- Handles ChatGPT SSE requirements (POST to SSE conversion)
- Should be deployed at api.jeanmemory.com

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue
The worker at api.jeanmemory.com appears to have SSE formatting issues:
- Adds indentation to `data:` fields
- This breaks the SSE specification
- ChatGPT cannot parse the malformed SSE

### üîß Solutions

#### Option 1: Update the Deployed Worker
1. Check the current deployment at api.jeanmemory.com
2. Update from the `jean-technologies/sse-worker` repository
3. Ensure it's the latest version without formatting issues

#### Option 2: Use Virginia Backend Directly
For testing, you can try the direct backend:
```
https://jean-memory-api-virginia.onrender.com/mcp/chatgpt/sse/{user_id}
```
Note: This only works for GET requests, not POST (which ChatGPT uses)

#### Option 3: Deploy Fresh Worker
1. Clone https://github.com/jean-technologies/sse-worker
2. Deploy with `npx wrangler deploy --env production`
3. Update the custom domain configuration

## Testing

Test the SSE endpoints:
```bash
# Test current api.jeanmemory.com (check for indentation issues)
curl -N https://api.jeanmemory.com/mcp/chatgpt/sse/USER_ID

# Test Virginia backend (works for GET only)
curl -N https://jean-memory-api-virginia.onrender.com/mcp/chatgpt/sse/USER_ID

# Test POST (required by ChatGPT, should work on Cloudflare Worker)
curl -X POST https://api.jeanmemory.com/mcp/chatgpt/sse/USER_ID
```
