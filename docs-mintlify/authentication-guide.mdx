## OAuth 2.1 for Modern AI

Jean Memory uses the OAuth 2.1 authorization framework, the industry-standard protocol for authorization. This ensures that your integration is secure, scalable, and compatible with the latest AI standards, including the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

Our implementation of OAuth 2.1 is designed to be straightforward for developers while providing robust security for end-users.

### Key Features

- **PKCE for Enhanced Security**: All of our OAuth flows use Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) to protect against authorization code interception attacks.
- **Granular Scopes**: You can request specific permissions from users, ensuring that your application only has access to the data it needs.
- **Short-Lived Access Tokens**: Access tokens are short-lived, reducing the risk of them being compromised.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived refresh tokens allow your application to maintain a persistent connection to the Jean Memory API without requiring users to re-authenticate.

### The MCP Connection

The Model Context Protocol is a new standard for stateful, bidirectional communication between AI models and external tools. Jean Memory's support for OAuth 2.1 makes it a first-class citizen in the MCP ecosystem, allowing you to build powerful, agentic systems that can securely access a user's memories.
