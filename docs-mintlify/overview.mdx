## What is Jean Memory?

Jean Memory is a universal memory layer for AI applications. It gives your AI a persistent, cross-platform memory, allowing it to remember past conversations and context.

The core philosophy is **Context Engineering, not just Information Retrieval**. This means Jean Memory doesn't just store dataâ€”it intelligently understands, synthesizes, and prepares the perfect context for your AI, right when it's needed.

This is all orchestrated through a single, powerful `jean_memory` tool, which acts as a "tool of tools" to provide intelligent, agentic memory with long-term context.

## High-Level Architecture

At a high level, Jean Memory sits between your application and the AI models, providing the necessary context to make the AI's responses personal and relevant.
