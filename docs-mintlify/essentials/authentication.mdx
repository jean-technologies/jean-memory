## Overview

Jean Memory supports two authentication methods to ensure compatibility across different platforms while maintaining security.

## API Key Authentication

<Info>
  **Recommended for:** Web applications, backend services, and direct API integration
</Info>

API keys provide full access to all Jean Memory features including metadata tagging and advanced filtering.

### Getting your API Key

1. Sign in to your [Jean Memory Dashboard](https://jeanmemory.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Click "Generate New Key"
4. Copy and securely store your key

### Using your API Key

Include your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.jeanmemory.com/mcp/messages/ \
  -H "X-Api-Key: jean_sk_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

<Warning>
  API keys have full access to your account. Never share them publicly or commit them to version control.
</Warning>

## Header Authentication

<Info>
  **Used by:** Claude Desktop, existing MCP integrations
</Info>

This authentication method is used internally by MCP-compatible applications and provides a simplified toolset.

### Required Headers

```bash
x-user-id: your-supabase-user-id
x-client-name: your-app-name
```

### Limitations

Header authentication provides access to basic memory operations but excludes:
- Metadata tagging
- Advanced filtering
- Bulk operations
- Analytics

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Environment Variables" icon="lock">
    Always store API keys in environment variables:
    ```bash
    JEAN_API_KEY=jean_sk_your_api_key_here
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Key Rotation" icon="rotate">
    Rotate your API keys regularly:
    - Every 90 days for production
    - Immediately if compromised
    - When team members leave
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Restrict Key Scope" icon="shield">
    Create separate keys for different environments:
    - Development
    - Staging
    - Production
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor Usage" icon="chart-line">
    Check your API usage regularly:
    - Review access logs
    - Set up alerts for unusual activity
    - Monitor rate limit consumption
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Invalid API Key">
    Ensure your key starts with `jean_sk_` and hasn't been revoked
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authentication Failed">
    Check that you're using the correct header name (`X-Api-Key` with capital X)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rate Limited">
    Review your plan limits and consider upgrading if needed
  </Step>
</Steps>
