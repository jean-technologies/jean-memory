description: "The core MCP tools that power Jean Memory's intelligence."
---

Jean Memory is built on a foundation of powerful, modular tools that are orchestrated through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows for a flexible and extensible system that can adapt to a wide range of use cases.

## The `jean_memory` Tool

The `jean_memory` tool is the heart of the system. It is the primary interface for all conversational interactions and is responsible for orchestrating the other tools to provide intelligent, context-aware responses.

```typescript
interface JeanMemoryParams {
  user_message: string;
  is_new_conversation: boolean;
  needs_context: boolean;
}
```

**Usage:**
- **ALWAYS** use for conversational interactions.
- Set `is_new_conversation=true` for the first message in a new conversation.
- Set `needs_context=false` for general knowledge questions that don't require personal context.

## Memory Tools

These tools are the building blocks of Jean Memory's storage and retrieval system. They are used by the `jean_memory` tool to manage a user's memories.

### `add_memories`

Intelligently processes and stores new memories with automatic deduplication.

```typescript
add_memories(text: string, tags?: string[], priority?: boolean): string
```

### `search_memory`

Advanced semantic search that finds relevant memories based on context, not just keywords.

```typescript
search_memory(query: string, limit?: number, tags_filter?: string[]): string
```

### `list_memories`

Retrieves a paginated list of all memories for a user.

```typescript
list_memories(limit?: number, offset?: number): string
```

## REST API

For developers who prefer a more traditional RESTful approach, we also provide a comprehensive REST API for managing memories.

### Authentication

Authentication is handled via API key.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
# OR
X-Api-Key: jean_sk_<key>
```

### Common Endpoints

**Create Memory**
```http
POST /api/v1/memories
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "content": "User prefers dark mode",
  "app_name": "my-app"
}
```

**Search Memories**
```http
GET /api/v1/memories/search?q=preferences&limit=10
```

**Get Apps**
```http
GET /api/v1/apps
```
