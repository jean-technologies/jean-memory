Jean Memory is built from powerful core tools that work together to provide intelligent memory management for your AI applications.

## add_memory

The foundation of Jean Memory's storage system. Intelligently processes and stores new memories with automatic deduplication.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from jeanmemory import add_memory

add_memory(
    user_id="user123",
    content="I love hiking in the mountains",
    metadata={"category": "personal", "source": "chat"}
)
```

```javascript Node.js
import { addMemory } from '@jeanmemory/node';

await addMemory({
  userId: 'user123',
  content: 'I love hiking in the mountains',
  metadata: { category: 'personal', source: 'chat' }
});
```

```bash REST API
curl -X POST https://api.jeanmemory.com/v1/memories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer jean_sk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user123",
    "content": "I love hiking in the mountains",
    "metadata": {"category": "personal", "source": "chat"}
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

**Features:**
- Automatic deduplication prevents memory bloat
- Intelligent categorization and tagging
- Metadata support for rich context
- Background processing for optimal performance

## search_memory

Advanced semantic search that finds relevant memories based on context, not just keywords.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from jeanmemory import search_memory

results = search_memory(
    user_id="user123",
    query="outdoor activities I enjoy",
    limit=5
)
```

```javascript Node.js
import { searchMemory } from '@jeanmemory/node';

const results = await searchMemory({
  userId: 'user123',
  query: 'outdoor activities I enjoy',
  limit: 5
});
```

```bash REST API
curl -X GET "https://api.jeanmemory.com/v1/memories/search?user_id=user123&query=outdoor%20activities%20I%20enjoy&limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer jean_sk_..."
```
</CodeGroup>

**Features:**
- Semantic understanding beyond keywords
- Contextual relevance scoring
- Configurable result limits
- Real-time search performance
