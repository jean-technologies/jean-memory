## Example: AI-Powered Customer Support

Hereâ€™s a conceptual example of how you might build an AI-powered customer support chatbot with Jean Memory.

### 1. Store Every Interaction

Every time a user interacts with your support bot, you save the conversation to their memory.

```javascript
// User opens a support ticket
const conversation = "User is having trouble with billing. They were charged twice for their last invoice.";

await agent.addMemory(conversation, { tags: ['support', 'billing'] });
```

### 2. Retrieve Context When Needed

When the user starts a new conversation, you can search their memory to understand their history.

```javascript
// User starts a new chat
const userHistory = await agent.searchMemories("billing issues");

// Provide this context to the AI
const prompt = `
  Here is the user's recent support history:
  ${userHistory}

  Now, please respond to their new message: "I have another question about my bill."
`;
```

### 3. Provide a Better Experience

The AI now has the context it needs to provide a personalized and helpful response, without asking the user to repeat themselves.

> **AI Response:** "Of course! I see that you had an issue with being double-charged on your last invoice. I've already credited your account for that. What is your new question? I'm here to help."
