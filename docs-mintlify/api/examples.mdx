## Example: AI-Powered Customer Support

Hereâ€™s a conceptual example of how you might build an AI-powered customer support chatbot with Jean Memory.

### 1. Store Every Interaction

Every time a user interacts with your support bot, you save the conversation to their memory.

```javascript
// User opens a support ticket
const conversation = "User is having trouble with billing. They were charged twice for their last invoice.";

await agent.addMemory(conversation, { tags: ['support', 'billing'] });
```

### 2. Retrieve Context When Needed

When the user starts a new conversation, you can search their memory to understand their history.

```javascript
// User starts a new chat
const userHistory = await agent.searchMemories("billing issues");

// Provide this context to the AI
const prompt = `
  Here is the user's recent support history:
  ${userHistory}

  Now, please respond to their new message: "I have another question about my bill."
`;
```

### 3. Provide a Better Experience

The AI now has the context it needs to provide a personalized and helpful response, without asking the user to repeat themselves.

> **AI Response:** "Of course! I see that you had an issue with being double-charged on your last invoice. I've already credited your account for that. What is your new question? I'm here to help."

## Example: Personalized Learning Assistant

Here's how you could build an adaptive tutoring system using Jean Memory.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript React
import { useJeanAgent, JeanChat } from '@jeanmemory/react';

function MathTutor() {
  const { agent } = useJeanAgent({
    systemPrompt: `You are a patient math tutor. Always check the student's 
    learning history before responding. Adapt your teaching style based on 
    their past struggles and successes.`
  });

  const handleNewSession = async () => {
    // Retrieve student's learning profile
    const learningHistory = await agent.searchMemories(
      "math concepts difficulty level progress"
    );
    
    // Context is automatically provided to the AI
    return agent;
  };

  return <JeanChat agent={agent} />;
}
```

```python Python
from jeanmemory import JeanAgent

class PersonalTutor:
    def __init__(self, student_id, api_key):
        self.agent = JeanAgent(api_key=api_key, user_id=student_id)
        
    async def track_progress(self, topic, difficulty, success_rate):
        """Track student progress on specific topics"""
        progress = f"Student practiced {topic} at {difficulty} level with {success_rate}% success rate"
        
        await self.agent.add_memory(
            progress,
            metadata={
                "type": "progress",
                "topic": topic,
                "difficulty": difficulty,
                "success_rate": success_rate
            }
        )
    
    async def get_personalized_lesson(self, requested_topic):
        """Generate lesson based on student's history"""
        history = await self.agent.search_memories(f"{requested_topic} progress difficulty")
        
        # AI uses this context to personalize the lesson
        return await self.agent.chat(f"Create a lesson plan for {requested_topic}")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Example: Smart Shopping Assistant

Build an e-commerce assistant that remembers preferences and shopping patterns.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
import { JeanAgent } from '@jeanmemory/node';

class ShoppingAssistant {
  constructor(userId, apiKey) {
    this.agent = new JeanAgent({ userId, apiKey });
  }

  async trackPurchase(product, category, satisfaction) {
    await this.agent.addMemory(
      `Purchased ${product} in ${category} category, satisfaction: ${satisfaction}/5`,
      { 
        type: 'purchase',
        category,
        product,
        satisfaction,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      }
    );
  }

  async getRecommendations(budget, occasion) {
    const shoppingHistory = await this.agent.searchMemories(
      `purchases preferences satisfaction ${occasion}`
    );
    
    return await this.agent.chat(
      `Based on my shopping history, recommend products for ${occasion} within $${budget} budget`
    );
  }
}
```

```python Python
from jeanmemory import JeanAgent

class ECommerceBot:
    def __init__(self, customer_id, api_key):
        self.agent = JeanAgent(api_key=api_key, user_id=customer_id)
    
    async def remember_preferences(self, preferences):
        """Store customer preferences"""
        await self.agent.add_memory(
            f"Customer preferences: {preferences}",
            metadata={"type": "preferences"}
        )
    
    async def smart_search(self, query):
        """Search products with personalized context"""
        context = await self.agent.search_memories("preferences purchases liked disliked")
        
        # AI considers purchase history and preferences
        return await self.agent.chat(
            f"Help me find {query} based on my shopping history and preferences"
        )
```
</CodeGroup>
