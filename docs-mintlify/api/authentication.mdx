Authentication in Jean Memory is designed to be both secure and flexible, catering to different use cases. The primary method for all developers is a secret API key. For advanced use cases, we also offer the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an alternative to our REST API.

## API Key (for REST API & SDK)

When you, as a developer, build an application using our REST API or SDKs, you'll use a secret API key to authenticate your application with Jean Memory. This key grants your application access to the API on your behalf.

You can find your API key in the [Jean Memory Dashboard](https://jeanmemory.com/dashboard).

<Info>
All secret keys are prefixed with `jean_sk_`. Keep this key secure and never expose it in a client-side application.

### Using Your Key

Include your API key as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl https://api.jeanmemory.com/agent/v1/mcp/messages/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer jean_sk_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

## End-User Authorization via SDK

When an end-user of your application wants to connect their Jean Memory, your application needs to get their permission to access their memories. Our React SDK makes this easy with the `SignInWithJean` component, which initiates an OAuth flow for the user to grant your application access.

Your developer API key is used to identify your application, but the memory operations are performed on behalf of the authenticated end-user.

```javascript
import { useJeanAgent, SignInWithJean, JeanChat } from '@jeanmemory/react';

function MyApp() {
  const { agent, signIn, isAuthenticated } = useJeanAgent({ 
    apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_JEAN_API_KEY 
  });
  
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <SignInWithJean onSuccess={signIn} />;
  }
  
  return <JeanChat agent={agent} />;
}
```

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Authentication

For advanced developers building agentic systems, MCP offers a more powerful, stateful alternative to our REST API. MCP uses a standard OAuth 2.0 flow for authentication, which is handled automatically when you connect to an MCP server.

You can learn more in the [MCP Introduction](/mcp/introduction).
