description: 'How to authenticate with the Jean Memory API.'
---

Authentication in Jean Memory is designed to be both secure and flexible, catering to different use cases. The primary method for all developers is a secret API key. For advanced use cases, we also offer the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an alternative to our REST API.

## API Key (for REST API & SDK)

When you, as a developer, build an application using our REST API or SDKs, you'll use a secret API key to authenticate your application with Jean Memory. This key grants your application access to the API on your behalf.

You can find your API key in the [Jean Memory Dashboard](https://jeanmemory.com/dashboard).

<Info>
All secret keys are prefixed with `jean_sk_`. Keep this key secure and never expose it in a client-side application.

### Using Your Key

Include your API key as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl https://api.jeanmemory.com/agent/v1/mcp/messages/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer jean_sk_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

## End-User Authorization via SDK

When an end-user of your application wants to connect their Jean Memory, your application needs to get their permission to access their memories. Our React SDK makes this easy with the `SignInWithJean` component, which initiates an OAuth flow for the user to grant your application access.

Your developer API key is used to identify your application, but the memory operations are performed on behalf of the authenticated end-user.

```javascript
import { useJeanAgent, SignInWithJean, JeanChat } from '@jeanmemory/react';

function MyApp() {
  const { agent, signIn, isAuthenticated } = useJeanAgent({ 
    apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_JEAN_API_KEY 
  });
  
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <SignInWithJean onSuccess={signIn} />;
  }
  
  return <JeanChat agent={agent} />;
}
```

## OAuth 2.1 for MCP Applications

For MCP applications that need to access user memories, Jean Memory implements OAuth 2.1 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security.

### MCP OAuth Flow

1. **Authorization Request**: Your MCP application redirects users to Jean Memory's authorization server
2. **User Consent**: Users grant permission for your application to access their memories
3. **Authorization Code**: Jean Memory redirects back with an authorization code
4. **Token Exchange**: Your application exchanges the code for access and refresh tokens

<CodeGroup>
```javascript MCP Client Setup
// Configure your MCP client with OAuth
const mcpClient = new McpClient({
  oauth: {
    clientId: 'your_mcp_client_id',
    redirectUri: 'https://yourapp.com/oauth/callback',
    scopes: ['read_memories', 'write_memories']
  }
});

// Initiate OAuth flow
await mcpClient.authorize();
```

```python Python MCP
import mcp_client

client = mcp_client.Client(
    oauth_config={
        'client_id': 'your_mcp_client_id',
        'redirect_uri': 'https://yourapp.com/oauth/callback',
        'scopes': ['read_memories', 'write_memories']
    }
)

# Start OAuth flow
await client.authorize()
```
</CodeGroup>

### OAuth Scopes

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read_memories` | Access to search and retrieve user memories |
| `write_memories` | Ability to add new memories |
| `delete_memories` | Permission to delete user memories |
| `profile` | Access to basic user profile information |

### Security Features

- **PKCE**: All OAuth flows use Proof Key for Code Exchange for enhanced security
- **Short-lived tokens**: Access tokens expire after 1 hour
- **Refresh tokens**: Long-lived tokens for seamless re-authentication
- **Scope limitation**: Fine-grained permissions control

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Authentication

For advanced developers building agentic systems, MCP offers a more powerful, stateful alternative to our REST API. Authentication is handled through the OAuth 2.1 flow described above.
