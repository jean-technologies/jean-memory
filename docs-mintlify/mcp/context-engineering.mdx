## Context Engineering, Not Information Retrieval

Jean Memory's core philosophy is **Context Engineering**, not just Information Retrieval. This means the system doesn't just store and retrieve memoriesâ€”it intelligently engineers context for your AI assistant. This is the key to making AI truly personal and useful.

The system is designed to:
-   Select the *right* information at the *right* time.
-   Synthesize insights from disparate memories.
-   Understand relationships between memories.
-   Predict what context will be most useful.

This approach is inspired by Rich Sutton's "The Bitter Lesson," which argues that leveraging AI's intelligence is more effective than hand-coded heuristics. Jean Memory uses AI to decide what to remember, what context is relevant, and how to synthesize new insights.

## The `jean_memory` Tool: A Tool of Tools

The `jean_memory` tool is the heart of the system. It's the primary interface for your AI to interact with the memory layer. It's a "tool of tools" that orchestrates various underlying memory functions to provide the right context at the right depth, with built-in intelligence and long-context awareness.

```python
@mcp.tool(description="ðŸŒŸ ALWAYS USE THIS TOOL!!!")
async def jean_memory(
    user_message: str, 
    is_new_conversation: bool, 
    needs_context: bool
) -> str:
```

### Execution Flow

The `jean_memory` tool uses a dual-path asynchronous process to provide a fast response while performing deeper analysis in the background.

1.  **Immediate Path (< 3 seconds)**:
    -   If `needs_context=false`, it returns immediately.
    -   If `needs_context=true`, it runs a fast vector search to get the most relevant context instantly.

2.  **Background Path 1 - Smart Triage**:
    -   Triggered for **every** message.
    -   Uses a fast AI model (Gemini Flash) to analyze the message and decide whether to **REMEMBER** or **SKIP** it.
    -   If it decides to **REMEMBER**, it saves the memory in the background.

3.  **Background Path 2 - Deep Analysis**:
    -   Only runs if `needs_context=true`.
    -   Performs a full context engineering pipeline to synthesize insights from multiple memories.
    -   This can take 30-60 seconds and creates high-priority "insight memories."

## Smart Context Orchestrator

The `SmartContextOrchestrator` is the brain behind the `jean_memory` tool. It uses different strategies to create the best possible context for the AI.

### Context Strategies

1.  **`deep_understanding`**: Used for new conversations to provide comprehensive context about the user.
2.  **`relevant_context`**: Used for ongoing conversations to provide targeted, relevant information.
3.  **`comprehensive_analysis`**: Used for deep queries like "tell me everything you know about X" to do a full scan of all available information.

By using these strategies, Jean Memory ensures that the AI has the perfect amount of context to be helpful without being overwhelmed by information.
