## Copy-Paste All Documentation

Don't like reading docs? Paste this into your AI coding tool (Cursor, Claude, etc.), give it instructions for what you'd like to build, and have it build it for you.

<CodeBlock language="markdown" showLineNumbers={false} collapsible={true}>
  {
    require('!!raw-loader!./consolidated-api-docs.mdx').default
