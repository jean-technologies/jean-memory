  content={`# Jean Memory - Quick Implementation Guide

## What You're Building
A persistent memory system that lets AI remember everything across sessions.

## Installation & Setup

### React Implementation
\`\`\`bash
npm install @jeanmemory/react @assistant-ui/react
\`\`\`

\`\`\`javascript
import { useJeanAgent, SignInWithJean, JeanChat } from '@jeanmemory/react';

function App() {
  const { agent, signIn } = useJeanAgent({
    apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_JEAN_API_KEY,
    systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant"
  });

  if (!agent) return <SignInWithJean onSuccess={signIn} />;
  return <JeanChat agent={agent} />;
}
\`\`\`

### Python Implementation
\`\`\`bash
pip install jeanmemory
\`\`\`

\`\`\`python
from jeanmemory import JeanAgent

agent = JeanAgent(
    api_key=os.getenv("JEAN_API_KEY"),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant"
)
agent.run()
\`\`\`

## Environment Setup
Create .env file:
\`\`\`
JEAN_API_KEY=jean_sk_your_api_key_here
\`\`\`

## Test It Works
1. Run your app
2. Have a conversation
3. Close and reopen
4. The AI remembers everything

That's it! Your AI now has persistent memory.`}
/>

## The Problem

Every time you start a new chat with AI, you're a stranger again. Your preferences, context, ongoing projects - all gone. It's like Groundhog Day, but worse.

## The Solution

**5 lines of code.** That's all it takes to give any AI persistent, intelligent memory that follows you everywhere.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript React (Literally 5 lines)
import { useJeanAgent } from '@jeanmemory/react';

function App() {
  const { agent } = useJeanAgent({ apiKey: "jean_sk_..." });
  return <JeanChat agent={agent} />;
}
```

```python Python (Also 5 lines)
from jeanmemory import JeanAgent

agent = JeanAgent(api_key="jean_sk_...")
agent.run()
```
</CodeGroup>

    You: What should I work on today?
    AI: I don't have information about your current projects. 
        Could you tell me what you're working on?
    
    You: *sighs and explains everything again*
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="With Jean">
    ```
    You: What should I work on today?
    AI: Based on our discussion yesterday, you wanted to:
        1. Finish the API integration (you were stuck on auth)
        2. Review Sarah's PR for the dashboard
        3. Prep for tomorrow's standup about Q4 goals
