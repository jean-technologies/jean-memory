   - Time-aware episode modeling
   - Relationship discovery

3. **Unified Interface**
   - Single API endpoints
   - Combined search results
   - Backward compatibility maintained

### Infrastructure
- **Neo4j**: Running on port 7474 (HTTP) and 7687 (Bolt)
- **Qdrant**: Running on ports 6333 (HTTP) and 6334 (gRPC)
- **Environment**: USE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=true enables unified features

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Memory Addition
- **Mem0**: Successfully processes and extracts entities from text
- **Graphiti**: Creates temporal episodes with proper timestamps
- **Combined**: Both systems store complementary information

### Search Performance
