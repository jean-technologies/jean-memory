## FRD/EDD

### **Part 1 — Mini-FRD (What & Why)**

#### 1. **What**  
Remove the MigrationBanner component and its associated API endpoint calls from the dashboard page to clean up the UI after successful Qdrant migration completion.

#### 2. **Why**  
The migration banner was designed to notify users about the ongoing Qdrant migration process and show migration status. Since the migration has been completed system-wide, the banner serves no purpose and clutters the dashboard interface.

#### 3. **Scope**  

**In Scope:**
- Remove MigrationBanner import from dashboard page (`openmemory/ui/app/dashboard/page.tsx:20`)
- Remove MigrationBanner component usage from dashboard JSX (`openmemory/ui/app/dashboard/page.tsx:377`)
- Delete MigrationBanner component file (`openmemory/ui/app/dashboard/MigrationBanner.tsx`)
- Remove migration status API endpoint (`openmemory/api/app/routers/migration.py`)
- Remove migration router from main API (`openmemory/api/main.py`)

**Out of Scope:**
- Qdrant database cleanup
- SQL database schema changes
- Authentication flow modifications
- Other dashboard components

#### 4. **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] MigrationBanner import removed from dashboard page
- [ ] MigrationBanner component usage removed from dashboard JSX
- [ ] MigrationBanner.tsx file deleted
- [ ] Migration API endpoint `/api/v1/migration/status` removed
- [ ] Migration router removed from main API
- [ ] Dashboard loads without migration banner
- [ ] No console errors related to migration status checks
- [ ] Dashboard layout adjusts properly without banner space

### **Part 2 — Mini-EDD (How)**

#### **Technical Approach**

**Frontend Changes:**

1. **File: `openmemory/ui/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**
   - Remove import: `import { MigrationBanner } from "./MigrationBanner";` (line 20)
   - Remove JSX usage: `<MigrationBanner />` (line 377)

2. **File: `openmemory/ui/app/dashboard/MigrationBanner.tsx`**
   - Delete entire file (142 lines)

**Backend Changes:**

3. **File: `openmemory/api/app/routers/migration.py`**
   - Delete entire file (85 lines)

4. **File: `openmemory/api/main.py`**
   - Remove migration router import and include statement

#### **Implementation Steps**
1. Remove frontend MigrationBanner import and usage
2. Delete MigrationBanner component file  
3. Remove backend migration API endpoint
4. Test dashboard loads correctly without banner
5. Verify no broken API calls in browser console

#### **Risk Assessment**
- **Low Risk:** Migration banner is self-contained with no dependencies
- **No Data Loss:** No user data affected by removal
- **Reversible:** Changes can be rolled back from git history if needed

#### **Testing**
- Load dashboard page and verify banner is gone
- Check browser console for any migration-related API errors
- Verify dashboard layout looks correct without banner space
- Test with both migrated and non-migrated user accounts (if any remain)

## Current Implementation Analysis

### **Migration Banner Component Structure**

**Location:** `openmemory/ui/app/dashboard/MigrationBanner.tsx`

**Key Features:**
- Checks migration status via API call to `/api/v1/migration/status`
- Conditionally renders banner based on migration completion
- Shows loading state while checking status
- Displays migration progress with memory counts
- Hides automatically when migration is complete (`isMigrated: true`)

**API Endpoint:** `openmemory/api/app/routers/migration.py`

**Functionality:**
- Queries SQL database for active memories count
- Checks Qdrant collection existence and vector count
- Determines migration status based on Qdrant vector presence
- Returns structured response with counts and status

**Integration Points:**
- Imported in `openmemory/ui/app/dashboard/page.tsx:20`
- Rendered in dashboard JSX at line 377
- Registered in main API router

### **Files to Modify/Delete**

1. **Delete:** `openmemory/ui/app/dashboard/MigrationBanner.tsx`
2. **Delete:** `openmemory/api/app/routers/migration.py`
3. **Modify:** `openmemory/ui/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (remove import and usage)
4. **Modify:** `openmemory/api/main.py` (remove migration router)
