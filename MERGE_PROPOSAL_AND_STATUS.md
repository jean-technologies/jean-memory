# Project Status & Merge Proposal: Universal OAuth Implementation

**Date:** August 17, 2025
**Branch:** `feature/universal-identity-poc`

---

## 1. Where We Were: The Problem

-   **Brittle Architecture:** Our authentication relied on the `oauth-bridge.html` file, which used a client-side Supabase flow. This was proving unreliable and difficult to manage for external applications (like the React SDK and Claude MCP).
-   **Core Conflict:** The root cause was an architectural mismatch. We were trying to force Supabase—a tool designed for single-domain applications—to handle a multi-domain, universal authentication requirement.
-   **Symptoms:** This conflict led to issues like "domain hijacking" by Supabase and unsolvable PKCE security errors when trying to work around it.

## 2. Where We Are Now: The Solution Implemented

We have designed and implemented a new, robust, backend-driven authentication system that runs in parallel with the existing bridge, ensuring no disruption to your main web application.

**This branch is fully implemented and ready for testing.**

### Key Changes (The Diff):

1.  **New Backend Foundation (`settings.py`, `auth.py`):**
    -   We've added the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to the configuration, allowing our backend to securely manage users.
    -   We've implemented a **Supabase Admin Client** and the critical `get_or_create_user_from_provider` function. This is the heart of the universal identity system—it guarantees that any user signing in with an email is mapped to a single, permanent Supabase account, creating one if it doesn't exist.

2.  **New Universal OAuth Router (`routers/sdk_oauth.py`):**
    -   A new, self-contained router has been built to handle the entire OAuth 2.1 PKCE flow on the backend.
    -   It exposes the standard `/authorize`, `/callback`, and `/token` endpoints.
    -   This router correctly uses the new user creation logic to provide a consistent user ID.

3.  **API Integration (`main.py`):**
    -   The new `sdk_oauth.py` router has been properly registered within your main FastAPI application, making the new endpoints live.

4.  **Hardened Bridge (`oauth-bridge.html`):**
    -   As a safety measure, we also hardened the *existing* bridge before committing to the new path. We replaced a fragile timeout with a robust polling mechanism, which is a valuable improvement regardless.

### Is the Implementation Done?

**Yes.** The implementation of the new, parallel authentication flow is complete. The system is ready for the end-to-end testing outlined in the `TEST_PLAN_UNIVERSAL_OAUTH.md` document.

## 3. Where We Are Going: The Path Forward

Merging these changes is the correct and logical next step. This is a proper fix that addresses the root architectural problem.

### The Immediate Plan:

1.  **Review and Merge:** Review the changes on this branch. Once you are confident, merge `feature/universal-identity-poc` into `main`.
2.  **Configure Production:** Add the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` to your production environment variables on Render.
3.  **Test in Production:** Once deployed, perform a test using the same manual flow outlined in the test plan, but using your production URLs.

### The Long-Term Plan (Post-Merge):

1.  **Update SDKs:** The React SDK and any other clients need to be updated to point to the new `.../v1/sdk/oauth/authorize` endpoint instead of initiating the Supabase client-side flow.
2.  **Monitor:** Closely monitor the new flow's performance and success rate.
3.  **Decommission the Bridge (Eventually):** Once all external applications have been migrated to the new flow and it is proven to be stable, you can begin the process of migrating your main web application off the `oauth-bridge.html` and eventually remove it.

This implementation is not a temporary patch; it is the strategic foundation for a scalable and reliable universal authentication system.
