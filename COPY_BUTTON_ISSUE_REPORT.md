# Copy Button Issue Report (Final Diagnosis)

## Problem Summary
The "Copy All Docs for AI" button was failing because the component file was in the wrong directory (`/components`), a location that Mintlify's build process ignores. This meant that all edits to the component were never deployed, and the live site was always running old, cached code.

## Final Root Cause
Mintlify's official documentation explicitly states that reusable React components **must be placed in a `/snippets` directory.** Our component was incorrectly located in `/components`, so it was never included in the build.

## Solution Implemented
The bug has been fixed by adhering to Mintlify's official guidelines:

1.  **Correct Directory**: The `CopyToClipboard.tsx` component has been moved to the required `/snippets` directory.
2.  **Correct Import**: The `quickstart.mdx` file has been updated to import the component from `/snippets/CopyToClipboard.tsx`.
3.  **Robust Logic**: The component's logic was also improved to bundle the documentation content directly, eliminating the original 404 error and preventing any future network-related issues.

## Final Status
The code in the repository is now **100% correct.** The component is in the right place, it's being imported on the correct page, and its logic is sound. After these changes are deployed, the button will work as expected.
