# Summary of Reverted Changes (July 2nd)

This document outlines the features that were reverted to restore application stability. The root cause of the failure was a critical bug introduced in the `get_or_create_user` function, which had widespread effects across the application.

### 1. Automatic "New User Welcome" Email

*   **Goal:** To automatically add new users to Loops to trigger a welcome email.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   The `get_or_create_user` function in `openmemory/api/app/utils/db.py` was modified.
    *   A new function, `add_user_to_loops`, was created to handle the API call to Loops.
*   **Reason for Revert:**
    *   A bug (`AttributeError: type object 'User' has no attribute 'supabase_user_id'`) was introduced in the core logic of `get_or_create_user`.
    *   This function is critical for both creating new users and authenticating existing ones.
    *   The bug caused a crash that prevented new user sign-ups and broke features for existing users, such as the loading of the user narrative. The revert was necessary to bring the application back online immediately.

### 2. Email Automation Plan Documentation

*   **Goal:** To provide a clear plan for setting up both "New User" and "Pro Subscriber" email automations.
*   **Implementation:** A new documentation file was created at `jean_documentation/new/EMAIL_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`.
*   **Reason for Revert:** This file was created as part of the same set of changes and was removed when we reverted the code to a stable state.

### 3. SMS Welcome Message Update

*   **Goal:** To improve the initial SMS welcome message by explaining the different memory tools.
*   **Implementation:** The `welcome_message` text inside the `send_welcome_with_contact` function in `openmemory/api/app/utils/sms.py` was updated.
*   **Reason for Revert:** This was a minor change included in the larger batch of work that was reverted. This change can be safely re-implemented.
