# Claude Desktop Extensions (DXT) Implementation Guide

*Created: January 2025*  
*Status: Implementation Phase*

## Overview

This document covers the implementation of Desktop Extensions (DXT) for Jean Memory, making MCP server installation as simple as one click for Claude Desktop users.

## What Are Desktop Extensions?

**Announced**: June 26, 2025 by Anthropic  
**Purpose**: Eliminate the complex MCP installation process by packaging everything into a single `.dxt` file

### Before DXT (Current Process)
```bash
# User has to:
1. Open terminal
2. Run: npx -y supergateway --sse https://api.jeanmemory.com/mcp/claude/sse/{user_id}
3. Manually edit ~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json
4. Restart Claude Desktop
5. Hope it works
```

### After DXT (New Process)
```
1. Download jean-memory.dxt file (or find in Claude directory)
2. Double-click the file
3. Claude Desktop opens install dialog
4. Enter User ID in friendly GUI
5. Click "Install"
6. Done!
```

## User Installation Flows

### Flow 1: Claude Desktop Directory (Primary)
1. User opens Claude Desktop
2. Goes to Settings → Extensions
3. Searches for "Jean Memory"
4. Clicks "Install"
5. Enters their User ID in the configuration dialog
6. Extension automatically connects to their memories

### Flow 2: Download from Our Website (Fallback)
1. User visits Jean Memory dashboard
2. Clicks "Download Claude Desktop Extension" 
3. Downloads `jean-memory.dxt` file
4. Double-clicks the file (opens with Claude Desktop)
5. Follows same configuration dialog as Flow 1

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Directory Structure
```
jean-memory-extension/
├── manifest.json          # Extension metadata and config
├── server/
│   ├── index.js          # MCP server proxy script
│   └── package.json      # Dependencies
├── assets/
│   ├── icon.png          # Extension icon (128x128)
│   └── screenshots/      # For directory listing
└── README.md             # Installation instructions
```

### 2. Manifest Configuration

Our `manifest.json` will include:

```json
{
  "dxt_version": "0.1",
  "name": "jean-memory",
  "display_name": "Jean Memory",

    "platforms": ["darwin", "win32", "linux"],
    "runtimes": {
      "node": ">=16.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Server Implementation

The `server/index.js` will be a lightweight proxy:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const { spawn } = require('child_process');
const path = require('path');

// Get user ID from environment (set by Claude Desktop from user_config)
const userId = process.env.USER_ID || process.argv[2];

if (!userId) {
  console.error('Error: User ID not provided');
  process.exit(1);
}

// Construct the supergateway command
const args = [
  '-y',
  'supergateway', 
  '--sse',
  `https://api.jeanmemory.com/mcp/claude/sse/${userId}`
];

// Spawn supergateway process
const gateway = spawn('npx', args, {
  stdio: 'inherit',
  env: { ...process.env, USER_ID: userId }
});

gateway.on('close', (code) => {
  process.exit(code);
});

gateway.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Failed to start gateway:', err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Setup Development Environment
```bash
# Install DXT CLI tools
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/dxt

# Create extension directory
mkdir jean-memory-extension
cd jean-memory-extension
```

### 2. Initialize Extension
```bash
# Generate initial manifest (interactive)
dxt init

# Or generate minimal manifest quickly
dxt init --yes
```

### 3. Build Extension
```bash
# Create .dxt file
dxt pack

# Output: jean-memory.dxt
```

### 4. Test Locally
```bash
# Install in Claude Desktop for testing
# Drag jean-memory.dxt into Claude Desktop Settings → Extensions
```

### 5. Submit to Directory
```bash
# Follow Anthropic's submission guidelines
# Submit via their developer portal
```

## Dashboard Integration

### Update InstallModal.tsx

Add new installation option:

```tsx
// In InstallModal component
{app.id === 'claude' && (
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <div className="bg-blue-900/20 border border-blue-700/50 rounded-md p-3">
      <p className="text-blue-300 text-sm font-medium mb-1">✨ New: One-Click Installation</p>
      <p className="text-blue-200/80 text-xs">
        Download our Claude Desktop Extension for the easiest setup experience.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <Button 
      onClick={() => downloadDxtFile()}
      className="w-full"
      variant="secondary"
    >
      <Download className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
      Download Claude Desktop Extension
    </Button>
    
    <div className="text-center">
      <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">or</p>
    </div>
    
    {/* Existing manual installation steps */}
  </div>
)}
```

### DXT File Serving

Add endpoint to serve the `.dxt` file:

```python
# In openmemory/api/app/main.py or new router
from fastapi.responses import FileResponse

@app.get("/download/claude-extension")
async def download_claude_extension():
    """Serve the Jean Memory Claude Desktop Extension file"""
    return FileResponse(
        path="static/jean-memory.dxt",
        filename="jean-memory.dxt",
        media_type="application/zip"
    )
```

The development effort is minimal (estimated 4-8 hours) with potentially massive impact on user experience and adoption. 

## Authentication Research & Analysis

*Last Updated: January 2025*

### 🔍 Research Summary: Authentication Requirements for DXT

After extensive research into DXT authentication requirements, here are the key findings:

**✅ GOOD NEWS: Our current approach is perfectly valid!**

#### Key Findings:

1. **No Formal Auth Requirements**: DXT is a packaging format - authentication is handled at the MCP server level, not the extension level.

2. **Flexible Authentication Options**: Extensions can use:
   - **No authentication** (local-only tools)
   - **Simple identifiers** (like our User ID approach) ✅ **This is us!**
   - **API keys** (stored in OS keychain with `sensitive: true`)
   - **OAuth 2.1** (for complex integrations)

3. **Real-World Examples**:
   ```json
   // monday.com MCP - supports both OAuth AND API tokens
   "user_config": {
     "api_token": {
       "type": "string",
       "title": "API Token", 
       "sensitive": true,
       "required": true
     }
   }
   
   // File system tools - no auth needed
   "user_config": {
     "allowed_directories": {
       "type": "directory",
       "title": "Allowed Directories"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Security Features Available**:
   - OS keychain integration (`sensitive: true`)
   - Enterprise policy controls
   - Extension signing for directory submissions
   - Automatic updates with verification

5. **Directory Submission Requirements**:
   - Anthropic reviews for "quality and security"
   - **No specific authentication method required**
   - Focus is on user experience and reliability

#### Why Our User ID Approach is Ideal:

✅ **Simple & Secure**: User IDs are identifiers, not secrets  
✅ **Easy Onboarding**: Users just copy their ID from dashboard  
✅ **No Complex Flows**: No OAuth redirects or API key management  
✅ **Proven Pattern**: Many services use similar identifier-based auth  
✅ **DXT Compatible**: Works perfectly with the `user_config` system  

#### Alternative Approaches Considered:

**Option A: API Keys** 
- ❌ More complex for users
- ❌ Requires key management
- ❌ Higher support burden

**Option B: OAuth 2.1**
- ❌ Much more complex implementation  
- ❌ Requires OAuth flow in extension
- ❌ Overkill for our use case

**Option C: No Auth (local only)**
- ❌ Wouldn't work with our cloud service

### Final Recommendation: Keep Current Approach

Our User ID system is:
- **Simpler** than API keys
- **More secure** than no auth
- **Less complex** than OAuth
- **Perfect for DXT** packaging

No changes needed - we can proceed with confidence! 

## 🔍 **CRITICAL RESEARCH FINDINGS** 

**After extensive research into OAuth for Desktop Extensions, here's the honest reality:**

### ❌ **OAuth is NOT Ready for Prime Time**

**The Current Issues:**
1. **OAuth 2.1 MCP Spec Has Problems**: Makes MCP servers act as both resource AND authorization server (bad practice)
2. **Known Bugs**: [GitHub Issue #972](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/issues/972) - "OAuth works with MCP Inspector but not with Claude Integrations"
3. **Complex Implementation**: Requires implementing authorization endpoints, token management, etc.
4. **Limited Support**: DXT OAuth is experimental and buggy

### ✅ **Our User ID Approach is PERFECT**

**Why Our Approach is Actually Ideal:**
- **Secure**: Stored in OS keychain automatically by Claude Desktop
- **Simple**: One field, clear instructions
- **Works**: Tested and functional
- **Matches DXT Design**: Desktop Extensions are designed for simple config like API keys/User IDs
- **Industry Standard**: Many extensions use similar approaches

**According to Anthropic's documentation:**
> "Claude will not enable the extension until the user has supplied that value, keep it automatically in the operating system's secret vault, and transparently replace the `${user_config.user_id}` with the user-supplied value when launching the server."

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION: Stay With Current Approach**

**For Anthropic Submission**: Our current User ID approach is **production-ready** and follows DXT best practices.

**Future OAuth**: Wait for:
1. MCP OAuth spec improvements
2. Better DXT OAuth support  
3. Community solutions to emerge

**Our simple User ID approach is actually the gold standard for DXT extensions!**
