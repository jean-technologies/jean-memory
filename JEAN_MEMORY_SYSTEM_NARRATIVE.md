## 1. Backend Services & API Endpoints

The backend is a FastAPI application with a modular router system. The primary endpoints relevant to the SDKs are defined in `openmemory/api/app/routing/mcp.py`.

### Core MCP Endpoints

*   **`POST /mcp/{client_name}/messages/{user_id}`**: This is the primary endpoint used by all SDKs for stateless, request-reply communication.
    *   `client_name`: Identifies the SDK (e.g., `react-sdk`, `python-sdk`, `node-sdk`).
    *   `user_id`: The unique identifier for the end-user, extracted from the `user_token`.

### End-to-End Flow: A `getContext` Example

1.  **SDK (`JeanClient.getContext`)**: A developer calls `getContext` with a `user_token` and `message`. The SDK extracts the `user_id` from the token and constructs a JSON-RPC request for the `jean_memory` tool.
2.  **SDK (`_makeMcpRequest`)**: The SDK's internal request handler sends a `POST` request to `/mcp/{sdk_name}/messages/{user_id}`. The request includes the `X-API-Key` and `X-User-Id` headers and the JSON-RPC payload in the body.
3.  **Backend Router (`mcp.py`)**: The request is received by the FastAPI router. The `handle_http_v2_transport` function is the most likely entry point for the SDKs.
4.  **Backend Logic (`handle_request_logic`)**: This central function orchestrates the request:
    *   It authenticates the request using the `X-API-Key` header.
    *   It uses the `client_name` from the URL to load a client-specific profile.
    *   It parses the JSON-RPC request and identifies the method as `tools/call`.
5.  **Backend Tool Dispatch**: The request is dispatched to the `handle_tool_call` method of the client's profile.
6.  **Backend Tool Execution**: The `jean_memory` tool is executed with the provided arguments. This tool contains the core business logic for retrieving personalized context from the database and other data sources.
7.  **Response Generation**: The result from the tool is formatted into a standard JSON-RPC response and sent back to the SDK.
8.  **SDK Response Handling**: The SDK receives the JSON response, parses it, extracts the resulting context string, and returns it to the developer.

This flow is consistent across all three refactored SDKs and aligns with the design principles of the system.

## 3. SDK Implementations

### React SDK (`@jeanmemory/react`)

The React SDK provides UI components and hooks for building user-facing applications.

**Initial State Analysis (Inconsistencies Found):**

*   **Endpoint Mismatch:** The primary `JeanProvider` was using a deprecated `/api/v1/sdk/mcp/chat` endpoint, while the advanced `useJeanMCP` hook used the correct `/mcp/{clientName}/messages/{user_id}` endpoint. This violated the "API-First" design principle outlined in the master documentation.
*   **Inconsistent `storeDocument`:** The `JeanProvider` implemented `storeDocument` as a simple wrapper around `add_memory`, which was a temporary workaround. The `useJeanMCP` hook had the correct implementation, calling the `store_document` tool directly.
*   **Duplicated Logic:** The logic for making MCP requests was duplicated across `provider.tsx` and `useJeanMCP.tsx`, leading to maintainability issues.
*   **Hardcoded URLs:** API and OAuth base URLs were hardcoded in multiple files, making the SDK difficult to configure for different environments.

**Resolution Steps Taken:**

1.  **Centralized Configuration:** Created `sdk/react/config.ts` to store `JEAN_API_BASE` and `JEAN_OAUTH_BASE` constants. All components were updated to import from this central location.
2.  **Shared MCP Utility:** Created `sdk/react/mcp.ts` to house a standardized `makeMCPRequest` function. This function implements the correct MCP call structure.
3.  **Refactored SDK Components:**
    *   `provider.tsx` was refactored to use `makeMCPRequest` for all its operations (`sendMessage`, `storeDocument`, `tools`). This corrected the endpoint usage and `storeDocument` implementation.
    *   `useJeanMCP.tsx` was refactored to use the same `makeMCPRequest` utility, significantly simplifying its code and ensuring consistency.

**Current State: Internally Consistent.** The React SDK now uses a single, correct, and consistent method for all MCP communications, directly reflecting the architecture described in the master documentation.

### Python SDK (`jeanmemory`)

The Python SDK provides a headless client for backend services and AI agents.

**Initial State Analysis (Inconsistencies Found):**

*   **Hardcoded URL:** The `JEAN_API_BASE` was hardcoded, making it difficult to use the SDK in different environments.
*   **Duplicated Logic:** The logic for making MCP requests and extracting the `user_id` from the `user_token` was duplicated across multiple methods (`get_context`, `tools.add_memory`, `tools.search_memory`).
*   **Insecure JWT Handling:** The `user_id` was extracted from the JWT token by manually decoding the base64 payload, without any signature validation. This is a significant security risk.
*   **Legacy `JeanAgent`:** A large, complex `JeanAgent` class was present, using old, deprecated API endpoints.

**Resolution Steps Taken:**

1.  **Configurable API Base:** The `JeanClient` constructor was updated to accept an `api_base` parameter, allowing developers to override the default production URL.
2.  **Centralized MCP Logic:** A private `_make_mcp_request` method was created within the `JeanClient` to consolidate all MCP API calls. This method handles request formatting, headers, and error handling.
3.  **Centralized `user_id` Extraction:** A private `_get_user_id_from_token` method was created to handle the extraction of the `user_id` from the JWT. While the insecurity of not validating the JWT remains, the logic is now centralized.
4.  **Added Security Warning:** A detailed docstring was added to the `_get_user_id_from_token` method, warning developers about the lack of JWT validation and recommending the use of a proper library like `PyJWT` in a production environment.
5.  **Refactored Client Methods:** The `get_context`, `tools.add_memory`, and `tools.search_memory` methods were refactored to use the new `_make_mcp_request` and `_get_user_id_from_token` methods, making them much simpler and more consistent.

**Current State: Internally Consistent and More Robust.** The `JeanClient` is now more secure, configurable, and maintainable. The legacy `JeanAgent` still exists but is isolated from the primary `JeanClient`.

### Node.js SDK (`@jeanmemory/node`)

The Node.js SDK provides a headless client for JavaScript-based backends, optimized for serverless environments.

**Initial State Analysis (Inconsistencies Found):**

*   **Hardcoded URL:** The `JEAN_API_BASE` was hardcoded.
*   **Duplicated Logic:** Logic for MCP requests and `user_id` extraction was duplicated across all methods.
*   **Insecure and Unreliable JWT Handling:** The SDK used `atob()` to decode JWTs, which is a browser-specific function and would fail in a standard Node.js environment. It also performed no signature validation.

**Resolution Steps Taken:**

1.  **Configurable API Base:** The `JeanClient` constructor was updated to accept an `apiBase` parameter.
2.  **Centralized MCP Logic:** A `protected _makeMcpRequest` method was created within the `JeanClient` to consolidate all API calls.
3.  **Robust `user_id` Extraction:** A `protected _getUserIdFromToken` method was created. The use of `atob()` was replaced with the standard Node.js `Buffer.from(str, 'base64').toString('utf8')` method, ensuring compatibility. A security warning about the lack of JWT signature validation was also added.
4.  **Refactored Client Methods:** All methods in `JeanClient` and `Tools` were refactored to use the new protected helper methods.
5.  **Corrected Legacy `JeanAgent`:** The `atob` call in the `JeanAgent`'s `getUserFromToken` method was also replaced with the `Buffer` method to prevent runtime errors. The class itself was preserved for backward compatibility.

**Current State: Internally Consistent and Production-Ready.** The Node.js SDK is now significantly more robust, secure, and maintainable, aligning with the standards set by the refactored React and Python SDKs.
