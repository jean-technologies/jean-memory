# JIRA Task Templates for Jean Memory Optimization

## Task 1: AI Context Plan Caching

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** P0  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Sprint:** 1  
**Labels:** performance, optimization, backend, caching

**Summary:**
Add LRU cache for AI context plans to reduce Gemini API calls

**Description:**
```
## Problem
Every continuing conversation calls Gemini API for context planning (2-12s), representing 60-80% of total request time.

## Solution  
Implement LRU cache with 30-minute TTL for context plans based on message patterns.

## Impact
70-90% performance improvement for cached queries with 40-60% expected cache hit rate.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Cache successfully stores and retrieves context plans
- [ ] Cache hit rate achieves 40%+ within first week
- [ ] Response time for cached queries reduces by 70%+

**Sprint:** 1  
**Labels:** performance, optimization, backend, ai

**Summary:**
Bypass AI planning for simple queries using pattern matching

**Description:**
```

Simple queries (25-40% of interactions) trigger full AI planning unnecessarily.

## Solution
Pattern-based classification to bypass AI for greetings and simple questions.

## Impact
30-50% faster responses for simple queries without quality loss.

## Task 3: Background Narrative Generation

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** P0  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Sprint:** 2  
**Labels:** performance, optimization, backend, async

**Summary:**
Pre-compute user narratives asynchronously after memory saves

**Description:**
```
## Problem
New conversations trigger synchronous narrative generation taking 10-15 seconds.

## Solution
Generate narratives in background immediately after memory saves.

## Impact
90% reduction in new conversation time (15s to 1.5s).

## FRD Link
[OPTIMIZATION_MINI_FRDS.md#item-3-narrative-pre-computation]

## EDD Link
[OPTIMIZATION_MINI_FRDS.md#part-2--mini-edd-how-2]
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Narratives generate within 5 seconds of memory save
- [ ] New conversation response time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Narratives stay fresh (regenerated on significant changes)
- [ ] Background generation doesn't impact foreground performance
- [ ] Works for 100% of active users

## Task 4: Memory Search Caching

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** P1  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Sprint:** 3  
**Labels:** performance, optimization, backend, caching

**Summary:**
Cache Qdrant search results to reduce repeated vector queries

**Description:**
```
## Problem
Repeated search queries execute full Qdrant operations unnecessarily.

## Solution
Implement 10-minute TTL cache for search results with automatic invalidation.

## Impact
15-25% improvement for repeated searches with <1MB memory footprint.

## FRD Link
[OPTIMIZATION_MINI_FRDS.md#item-4-memory-search-result-caching]

## EDD Link
[OPTIMIZATION_MINI_FRDS.md#part-2--mini-edd-how-3]
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Cache successfully stores vector search results
- [ ] Cache invalidates on new memory additions
- [ ] 15%+ cache hit rate in production
- [ ] Memory usage < 1MB total
- [ ] Easy cache bypass for debugging

## Task 5: Parallel Context Strategies

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** P1  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Sprint:** 3  
**Labels:** performance, optimization, backend, async

**Summary:**
Optimize deep context strategies with parallel tool execution

**Description:**
```
## Problem
Heavy context strategies execute sequentially and can take 8+ seconds.

## Solution
Use asyncio.gather() to parallelize independent operations.

## Impact
40-60% faster execution for complex queries without quality loss.

## FRD Link
[OPTIMIZATION_MINI_FRDS.md#item-5-context-strategy-optimization]

## EDD Link
