# Jean Memory Context Engineering Optimization Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Based on extensive analysis of the jean_memory MCP tool performance bottlenecks, this document presents **8 focused, synergistic optimization items** to improve performance and speed of the context engineering algorithm. These items are prioritized by impact vs complexity and designed for incremental deployment within your current Render infrastructure constraints.

## Performance Analysis Key Findings

### Current Bottlenecks Identified
1. **AI Context Planning**: 60-80% of total request time (2-12 seconds)
2. **Complex Context Strategy Execution**: 20-30% of time (0.5-8 seconds)
3. **Narrative Generation for New Conversations**: 10-15 seconds when cache miss occurs
4. **Memory Search Operations**: ~100ms (minimal impact, contrary to initial assumptions)

### Critical Insight: FAISS Implementation Not Viable
The original SHORT_TERM_MEMORY_V2 documents explored implementing FAISS for semantic search, but analysis revealed:
- **Memory constraints**: 5000 vectors per user = 30.7MB, allowing only 16 concurrent users on Render
- **Complexity overhead**: Smart top-K algorithms require 40+ hours implementation
- **Marginal benefit**: Memory search is only 5% of total request time

## Optimization Items (Priority Order)

### 🚀 **Item 1: AI Context Plan Caching**

## Conclusion

This optimization roadmap provides a **pragmatic, high-impact approach** to improving jean_memory performance while respecting infrastructure constraints. By focusing on the actual bottlenecks (AI planning and context strategy execution) rather than memory search optimization, we can achieve significant performance gains with minimal risk and complexity.

The phased approach allows for incremental value delivery, with Phase 1 alone providing 60-70% performance improvement in just one week of development time.
