# Jonathan's Memory - SaaS MVP Status

This document tracks the progress of converting OpenMemory into a multi-tenant SaaS application ("Jonathan's Memory") with Supabase authentication.

## Overall Goal
Launch a functional multi-tenant Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with:
1.  User authentication (Supabase).
2.  User-scoped memory storage and retrieval.
3.  Deployment to a simple cloud platform (future phase).

## Current Phase: Backend Multi-Tenancy COMPLETE - Ready for Frontend Integration

### Completed Steps (Backend Authentication & Multi-Tenancy):
*   **Branch Creation:** Active development on `feat/supabase-auth-multitenancy`.
*   **Dependencies:** `supabase` package correctly configured in `requirements.txt`.
*   **Environment Configuration:** `.env` setup for Supabase, Qdrant, OpenAI, and `mem0` settings.
*   **Core Authentication (`app/auth.py`, `main.py`):** Supabase client initialized; `get_current_supa_user` FastAPI dependency implemented and applied to routers, resolving circular imports.
*   **`mem0` Client (`app/utils/memory.py`):** Configured for a static shared Qdrant collection, relying on `user_id` in `mem0` method calls for data isolation.
*   **Database Utilities (`app/utils/db.py`):** `get_or_create_user()` and `get_user_and_app()` adapted to use Supabase User IDs, mapping to local `User` table (PK `User.id` stores Supabase UUID).
*   **Routers Adapted (`memories.py`, `apps.py`, `stats.py`):** Endpoints refactored for Supabase JWT authentication and user-scoped data operations. Import issues and `ResponseValidationError` resolved.
*   **Missing Routers Handled:** Imports for non-existent routers commented out in `main.py`.
*   **MCP Server (`app/mcp_server.py`):** Adapted to use Supabase User ID from context for `mem0` calls and database interactions.
*   **Database Initialization:** Alembic migrations successfully run, creating necessary SQL tables.
*   **API Startup:** Backend API starts successfully.
*   **Functional API Testing:** Core memory CRUD operations (List, Create) successfully tested with two distinct users, confirming authentication, data creation, and data isolation (users only see their own data).

### Next Phase: Frontend Integration & Further Backend Refinements
1.  **Git Workflow:**
    *   Commit all recent successful backend changes to `feat/supabase-auth-multitenancy`.
    *   Merge `feat/supabase-auth-multitenancy` into `main`.
    *   Create a new branch from `main` for frontend development (e.g., `feat/frontend-supabase-integration`).
2.  **Frontend Development (`openmemory/ui`):**
    *   Integrate Supabase JS client for user authentication (signup, login, logout).
    *   Manage user sessions and JWTs on the client-side.
    *   Update UI components to make authenticated API calls to the backend, displaying user-specific memories and data.
3.  **Address Remaining Backend Issues (from Outstanding List below).**
4.  **MCP Client Adaptation:** Ensure any client connecting to MCP server's SSE endpoint provides the Supabase User ID in the path and that the SSE endpoint authentication is hardened.

### Key Outstanding Issues & Questions to Address (Post-MVP or in Parallel):
*   **`apps_router.py` Linter Errors**: Investigate and fix any remaining (likely cosmetic) linter errors if they cause issues or noise.
*   **SSE Endpoint Security (`mcp_server.py`)**: `handle_sse` endpoint needs robust JWT authentication for production environments.
*   **Missing Routers Implementation**: Decide on `users_router`, `feedback_router` (implement or confirm removal from `main.py` imports).
*   **Alembic Migrations for `User` Table**: Current setup works. Future schema changes or constraint adjustments may require new revisions.
*   **`check_memory_access_permissions` Function**: Review and adapt this function in `memories_router.py` more thoroughly for complex permission scenarios if needed beyond basic user ownership.
*   **`mem0` Multi-Tenancy Behavior Verification**: While API tests show isolation, deeper verification of `mem0`'s interaction with Qdrant payload for `user_id` could be beneficial for understanding.
*   **Email in MCP Context**: `get_user_and_app` is called with `email=None` in MCP tools; this is acceptable for MVP as `get_or_create_user` handles it, but could be enhanced if MCP clients can provide email.
*   **SQL `Memory` and `mem0_id` Linking**: Evaluate adding a dedicated `mem0_id` column to the `Memory` SQL table for robust linking to vector store entries (currently in metadata).
*   **Pydantic V2 Migration:** Address deprecation warnings for Pydantic V1 style models and validators in `app/schemas.py` and elsewhere.
