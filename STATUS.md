# Jonathan's Memory - SaaS MVP Status

This document tracks the progress of converting OpenMemory into a multi-tenant SaaS application ("Jonathan's Memory") with Supabase authentication.

## Overall Goal
Launch a functional multi-tenant Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with:
1.  User authentication (Supabase).
2.  User-scoped memory storage and retrieval.
3.  Deployment to a simple cloud platform (future phase).

## Current Phase: Backend - Authentication & Multi-Tenancy Implementation

### Completed Steps:
*   **Branch Creation:** User confirmed new Git branch `feat/supabase-auth-multitenancy` is active.
*   **Dependencies:** Corrected `supabase` package name and `mem0ai` version in `openmemory/api/requirements.txt`.
*   **Environment Configuration:** User provided with `.env` template; confirmed `.env` populated with actual secrets by user.
*   **Core Authentication (`openmemory/api/main.py`, `openmemory/api/app/auth.py`):** Logic moved to `app/auth.py`, resolving circular imports. Supabase client initialized. `get_current_supa_user` dependency implemented.
*   **`mem0` Client (`openmemory/api/app/utils/memory.py`):** Correctly configured for static shared Qdrant collection.
*   **Database Utilities (`openmemory/api/app/utils/db.py`):** Adapted for Supabase User IDs.
*   **Routers Adapted (`memories.py`, `apps.py`, `stats.py`):** Endpoints updated. Corrected imports, fixed `SyntaxError` in `apps.py`.
*   **Missing Routers Handled:** Imports for `users_router`, `feedback_router` commented out in `main.py`.
*   **MCP Server (`openmemory/api/app/mcp_server.py`):** Adapted for Supabase User ID context and `mem0` multi-tenancy.
*   **Database Initialization:** Successfully ran Alembic migrations (`make migrate` or `docker compose exec ... alembic upgrade head`), creating database tables (e.g., `openmemory.db` for SQLite).
*   **API Startup SUCCESSFUL:** Backend API now starts without Python import/syntax errors and with database tables initialized.

### Next Immediate Steps:
1.  **Functional API Testing (Manual/Automated):**
    *   **Obtain Supabase JWTs:** SUCCESS - User A and User B JWTs obtained.
    *   **Set JWT as Shell Variable:** User advised to set JWTs as shell variables.
    *   **Test `GET /api/v1/memories/` (List Memories for User A - Initial):** SUCCESS - Returned empty list.
    *   **Test `POST /api/v1/memories/` (Create Memory for User A):** SUCCESS - Memory created for User A.
    *   **Test `GET /api/v1/memories/` (List Memories for User A - After Create):** SUCCESS - Listed User A's memory.
    *   **Test `GET /api/v1/memories/` (List Memories for User B - Initial):** SUCCESS - Returned empty list for User B.
    *   **Test `POST /api/v1/memories/` (Create Memory for User B):** SUCCESS - Memory created for User B.
    *   **Test `GET /api/v1/memories/` (List Memories for User B - After Create):** SUCCESS - Listed User B's memory (and not User A's).
    *   **Test `GET /api/v1/memories/` (List Memories for User A - Final Check):** SUCCESS - Confirmed User A still only sees User A's memory. Data isolation verified for core memory list/create operations.
    *   **Overall API Testing Status:** Core authentication and multi-tenancy for memories verified!
2.  **Commit Changes:** User advised to commit all successful backend changes to the `feat/supabase-auth-multitenancy` branch.
3.  **Address Linter Errors in `apps_router.py`**: Investigate and fix any remaining (likely cosmetic) linter errors.
4.  **Review & Address Remaining Outstanding Issues.**

### Key Outstanding Issues & Questions to Address:
*   **`apps_router.py` Linter Errors**: While `SyntaxError` is fixed, some cosmetic linter warnings might persist.
*   **SSE Endpoint Security (`mcp_server.py`)**: `handle_sse` endpoint needs JWT authentication for production.
*   **Missing Routers Implementation**: Decide on `users_router`, `feedback_router` (create or confirm removal).
*   **Alembic Migrations for `User` Table**: Migrations run successfully creating initial tables. Future schema changes or constraint adjustments may require new revisions.
*   **`check_memory_access_permissions` Function**: Review and adapt this function in `memories_router.py` for the new auth system.
*   **`mem0` Multi-Tenancy Behavior Verification**: Confirm through testing that `mem0` correctly isolates data in Qdrant based on `user_id` passed to its methods.
*   **Email in MCP Context**: `get_user_and_app` is called with `email=None` in MCP tools; assess impact on user record creation.
*   **SQL `Memory` and `mem0_id` Linking**: Evaluate making `mem0_id` a dedicated column in the `Memory` SQL table for stronger linking.
