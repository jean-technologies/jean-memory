## 1. Project Objective

To design, build, and test a dedicated, stateless RESTful API to provide a shared, taggable memory pool for multi-agent systems ("swarms").

The primary goal is to create a robust, production-ready feature that is **architecturally isolated** from the existing MCP/SSE server, ensuring zero interference with current production tools while allowing new clients (e.g., external businesses like Koii) to use it securely.

For a visual overview of the final system, please see the [Architecture Diagram](./architecture.md).
